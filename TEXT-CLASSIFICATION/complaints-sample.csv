XXXX, Trans Union and XXXX. I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The response from XXXX and XXXX  was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XX/XX/XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. 
I wrote XXXX and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only XXXX wrote back a letter dated XX/XX/2019 stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. 

Trans Union never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019 to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with TransUnion, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. 

Please investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected. No I dont have to fight because XXXX, XXXX and Trans union all lied and said that XXXX verified and account which is impossible because my account with them is FROZEN and no one can access it but I.

Experian is reporting XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MD XXXX that address would removed and put back on. I have also never lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MD XXXX. 

XXXX has reported that an account for XXXX XXXX with last date reported XX/XX/XXXX, Experian and XXXX doesnt show enough information for the XXXX XXXX account. Theres no balance, no high credit limit, the date of last activity for experian is XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX is showing the dates of last active as XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX, how can that be if I filed bankruptcy years ago with this account?? Experian and XXXX doesnt have enough information about the count. Hey he dates of last activity are all mixed up, theres no information about the credit limit or anything. 

XXXX XXXX is showing that the account with XXXX was last active on XX/XX/XXXX. This is incorrect. XXXX is showing last active of XX/XX/XXXX and doesnt show balance for XXXX XXXX doesnt show any information on payment status or credit limit. There nothing showing what type of account it is. All this information doesnt seem like it has been verified because theres so much missing information. Experian. Shows that the account wasnt opened on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX and XXXX show Date opened on XX/XX/XXXX. What information is accurate?? 

XXXX is postponing XXXX as open account type but the account status says closed. The accounts also show that theres no high credit limit but theres a balance due of {$84.00}! How can that be. Date last active is incorrect as well. 

XXXX XXXX is showing for XXXX incorrect and missing information. Theres no balance for no high credit limit, no credit limit. XXXX shows account status as other but Experian shows as closed. Experian also has the account as last reported on XX/XX/XXXX and a XXXX shows XX/XX/XXXX. What is correct? Why is all the information reporting differently? 

XXXX XXXX is showing for XXXX that the account is indeterminate? Who is verifying this information? The account type is left blank, high credit limit is left blank. There is too much information left blank. 

XXXX is posting that I have 2 dismissed chapter XXXX and one dismissed Chapter XXXX. They are all missing information Reference numbers are wrong for The chapter XXXX. They also are saying I filed at US DISTRICT COURT that is incorrect. The status is missing, the date settled is missing, the liability amounts are missing. 

For XXXX its showing that I filed a chapter XXXX at BK ... who is Bk? This information is inaccurate. The date settled for the Bks are incorrect. 

Experian shows all inaccurate account reference numbers. Dates settles are incorrect. 

All these accounts are in violation of the FCRA. They have you provide me with how they verified any of this information which leaves me to believe that they are not conduction reasonable investigations or following then procedures or obeying laws.

A motion for continuance was requested as they billed medicaid. On XX/XX/XXXX the case was dropped as the situation was resolved. 

In XX/XX/XXXX i checked my credit report via XXXX and noticed i had a collections appearing. This was part of the collection that was solved and should not have appeared. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX MST i submitted a dispute with the credit agency XXXX  including the letter saying my medicaid covered it, the official case dismissed paper signed by a judge, and the original summons complaint. 

On XX/XX/XXXX i was told the dispute was unsuccesful. 

"" The company that reported the information has certified to XXXX that the information is accurate. This item was not changed as a result of our processing of your dispute. Please review your report for the details. '' Because the collection agency still said i owed. I did not.

03/05/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"This complaint dates back to last XX/XX/XXXX during a loan modification which was done with XXXX ( Account # XXXX ) my previous loan servicer this was after a 2 month forbearance after Hurricane Irma. They had indicated a shortage to my escrow account in the loan modification documents. I was provided different information every time I spoke on the phone with a XXXX   representative. One would say I had an overage, others would say I had a shortage. The modification documents indicated at {$1900.00} shortage. I called, I emailed and wrote letters, I requested a Escrow review of my account in XXXX and XXXX and was told one would be done. They kept delaying and I finally had to sign the Modification documents on XX/XX/XXXX under duress otherwise the Modification would be withdrawn. No review of my escrow was ever done by XXXX, I discovered what appears to be an error when I reviewed the two Escrow Disclosure statements from XXXX for XXXX and XXXX. The Escrow balance for XX/XX/XXXX shows an actual escrow balance of {$2200.00}, the next statement shows a XXXX actual balance for XXXX, a difference of XXXX when only XXXX should have been withdrawn from this account to pay for the monthly mortgage insurance. I have recently contacted by phone and email to XXXX and they have not responded. 

In XX/XX/XXXX my loan servicing was transferred to Mr Cooper ( Formerly Nationstar Mortgage. ) ( Account # XXXX ). Mr Cooper did do a escrow analysis in XXXX of XXXX. That analysis was completely mishandled and they indicate a shortage of XXXX in my account. Even though my account is currently at a XXXX deficit as of XX/XX/XXXX. Their major errors was their analysis to my Hazard insurance and Morgage insurance. They indicated the Hazard insurance was XXXX last year ( when it was actually XXXX ) and this year the correct amount of XXXX. The Mortgage insurance they again misquoted last year at XXXX ( the actual was XXXX ) and listed this year the correct amount at XXXX so they are showing a difference from last year to this year of XXXX increase. This is totally wrong. They are demanding the difference be paid in a lump sum or have my monthly payment increased to cover the shortage over a year period. I have contacted Mr Cooper by phone on  XX/XX/XXXX and was told someone would look at it but no one from their Escrow will call, just an email. I have also sent a letter stating the error. The new charges will be taking effect in XXXX so something needs to happen quickly. The simple facts are that my Hazard insurance has gone down from XXXX to XXXX. My taxes did go up from XXXX to XXXX, so the net effect of the two is only XXXX. I am already paying one shortage based on XXXX miscalculation and that was to be spread out over 5 years. 
I want both XXXX and Mr Copper to correct the errors made to my escrow account and have XXXX send the deficiency to Mr Cooper post haste. I want Mr Cooper to revise the shortage based on all of this information.

I have not received one email or one call with any explanation as to what is going on with my money and how they are handling the issue to in paying my taxes as XXXX County Appraisal District has not yet received any payment.

11/15/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"We have already tried to contact the company with the following complaint 3 times using different avenues. In the most recent email sent, we requested that they contact us to at least acknowledge that the complaint was received. We have gotten no responses since the complaint was first filed three weeks ago. The text of the submitted complaint follows. 

To whom it may concern : We are writing to submit a formal complaint regarding the poor service that we received while working with XXXX XXXX XXXX/Closing Mark Home Loan. We are strongly considering submitting a formal complaint to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and any similar state agency in Colorado and/or California, as we feel that there were instances that pushed the boundaries of acceptable and, possible, legal behavior. 
The entire loan process with this company, from start to finish, has been unprofessional at best to downright deceptive and, potentially, life-impacting. We have been forgotten, lied to, and put into stressful situations that, frankly, should never happen. We have been through multiple account officers and underwriters, been asked to submit documents multiple times, been told falsehoods, and, upon completing closing on XX/XX/XXXX, we received letters that appeared to be informing us that we had been denied for the loan that we closed on. 
The following is a summarized narrative of the timeline from starting the prequalification process to closing on the mortgage. This timeline has been compiled based upon timestamped communication ( both written and digital ). 
We started this journey in XX/XX/2019, upon starting the prequalification process. We submitted the requested information to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( herein after XXXX )  and promptly received a response on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, we received an initial workbook which showed us the expected loan amount, down payment amount, fees, etc. The individual that we started with was extremely responsive and helpful, answering any of our questions promptly and clearly. 
We toured the community and decided that it was a good fit for us. At that time, we were given the option of looking for outside financing options or pursuing financing with the related company, XXXX ; the related financing came with builder incentives. At no point were we pressured by the sales team at XXXX to go with XXXX. However, as we had already started the prequalification process ( and the subsequent hard hit to our credit scores ) and because of the very good service we had received to date, as well as the healthy builder incentive, we signed the sales contract with the commitment to pursue the mortgage through XXXX. The contract was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, following a discussion with both the sales team at XXXX and the XXXX representative. 
On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday ), we reached out to the XXXX representative to see what the next financing steps would be, as the sales team indicated that the mortgage company would reach out to us. The next day ( a Sunday ), the XXXX representative informed us that he would be running an automated approval and would reach out if he needed additional documents. We took this to mean that our application was complete enough to start the clock and was in process. At this point, we had not been told that additional documents would be required to complete our application, just that there may be a need for additional documentation. 
We did not hear back from the XXXX representative after that point. On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday, nearly two full calendar weeks from last contact ), we reached out to the XXXX representative again. By XX/XX/XXXX ( Wednesday ), we emailed the XXXX sales team for assistance ; they referred us to the president of the mortgage company. We were informed, by the president of the company, that the XXXX representative that had been handling our application had abruptly left XXXX and that our application had not been passed onto another case manager/loan officer. By that time, our required loan approval date had passed ; this date was stipulated in our sales contract. 
We were connected with a new XXXX representative ( herein after referred to as new XXXX representative or loan officer ) who informed us via email that our application was incomplete and that nothing had been processed in the intervening time. Again, we had been under the impression that our application was complete and in process since mid-XXXX. At that point, again, nearly two weeks had passed, and we did not receive a formal notification of incompleteness. 
During the subsequent document collection period, the loan officer asked we could put down another half percent, which would increase our down payment to 3.5 % of the sales price. We agreed that we could afford the extra 0.5 %, but asked if she was considering an FHA loan. She informed us that she was looking at that option. At that point, we stated that we did not want to pursue an FHA loan, but said that we would consider it if we could see all the financing options that she could offer us. We asked that we be provided with a worksheet showing all the offerings that we could qualify for, so that we could pick the option that best matched our needs. We never received a product comparison worksheet despite the written request. Additionally, we did not receive an updated worksheet showing our expected costs at this time. 

Subsequently, as we were loading additional documents into the XXXX portal when we noticed that we had a loan details section available. We opened that section of the webpage and saw that our loan had been started under an FHA program, despite the fact that we had told our loan officer that we did not want an FHA loan and despite the fact that we had not been given a worksheet showing our product options. We communicated to the loan officer that we emphatically did not want the FHA loan, as the fees associated with the loan would negate any benefit from going with XXXX, based upon the builder incentives. Additionally, both of us have strong credit scores and did not need the credit support to qualify for a mortgage. Instead of giving us a workbook showing us our different financing options, the loan officer changed the product type for the mortgage to a XXXX  XXXX  conventional loan. Again, at no point were we allowed to select our product type ( or informed that XXXX only offered a limited product selection ). We were not given the information needed to make an informed decision. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the first set of loan disclosure documents ; we were not talked through our product choices at this point. We promptly signed the loan disclosures, after saving a copy and reviewing in detail. At this point, we received our first estimate ( aside from the prequalification estimate provided in XXXX ) that showed our expected loan costs, rate, fees, etc. This information was not provided ahead of time and we were informed that we had only 72 hours to sign the documents. We were not given options on product type or any other factor. Additionally, we were not offered any assistance in understanding the documents that we were given or any help working through the legalese. 

It should be noted that we were informed, only by the disclosures, that the PMI would not be cancellable due to rising home values. At the outset, the original XXXX  representative implied ( though, notably, did not explicitly state ), that the home could be reappraised after a period of time and the new value used for the LTV calculation. Under the subsequent disclosures, it was apparent that the PMI could only cancellable via loan payments compared to the original appraised value at closing. While not a major issue, it is notable because it is contradictory to information that we had at outset. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an automated email informing us that we had updated disclosures to sign. The email did not indicate what the changes were, nor did the loan officer notify us at any point that changes had been made. Upon reviewing the disclosures, the changes were the addition of a TILA form ( that we did not receive in our original packet ), an additional {$200.00} fee, and the removal of our {$5000.00} earnest money deposit. As a result, our updated disclosures indicated that we would owe an additional {$5000.00} in cash for our down payment at closing.

We reached out the same date to the loan officer and received a response that equated to her not knowing what was going on. Upon further research, she informed us that she wasnt sure why the earnest money deposit was removed and that she would make sure that we would get updated documents showing the amount. We were told to be confident that the credit would be given at closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we were introduced via email to a loan processor ( herein after loan processor or underwriter ; this introduction came directly from the loan processor and the loan officer was not involved in the introduction. At this time, the loan processor stated that our loan was conditionally approved, dependent upon two document lists. One list was to be provided as soon as possible, while the other was due within 60 days of closing. At this point, we were at about a month and a half out from the point at which we had been originally led to believe that our application was complete.

Many of the documents requested at this time had already been submitted as part of our original loan package or the subsequent package initiated by the loan officer. We had to resend many of the documents and enter them onto an online portal. 

It should be noted, at this point, we sent images ( pictures ) of several of the documents to the loan processor. This was not an issue and she did not request that the documents be scanned or otherwise in a different format. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we began reaching out to the loan officer to get information for the mortgagee clause, as our insurance agent was requesting it before he could start the formal application and estimate process on his side. The next day, we were informed that a new loan processor ( different from the current underwriter ) would provide that information to our agent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we reached out to the loan processor, as we had not heard from her since we submitted our documents ( largely completed in XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, she responded and said that she received all our documents that that everything looks good at this time. She said that she would reach out closer to closing, but did not state why. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the loan officer informing us that XXXX had acquired Closing Mark Home Loans ( herein after CMHL ) and that our mortgage application would be acquired by CMHL. The email stated that our mortgage would be redisclosed and that we would need to sign updated disclosures. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a notification from CMHL stating that the XXXX mortgage application had been migrated to the new platform. We received new loan disclosures at that time. 

The XX/XX/XXXX letter informed us that we would be receiving an updated conditional approval. This is a month after we had originally been conditionally approved. The loan officer did not reach out to explain that a new application had been started on the new platform, hence the approval process was started over entirely. The document informed us that our application was started XX/XX/XXXX, though it was not explicitly made clear that it was a completely new loan application and not just a formality due to the new system. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the formal scheduling request for closing, via Closing Mark Settlement Services. While this was scheduled, we had not yet received a formal approval, final disclosures, or closing instructions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received 3 options for the interest rate lock. The option sheet was sent only with instructions to look at Options 1, 2 and 3, with no explanation for the calculations, differences, or any other factors. Upon reviewing them, the only option that we could follow the math on was Option 3. Given the previous difficulties in obtaining information from the loan officer, we decided to lock on the option that we could follow. Based on our math, the other two options did not appear to conform to standard amortization at the listed interest rates, but, again, we could not follow the math. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received our updated disclosures for the interest rate lock. This disclosure, like previous disclosures, did not have any charge for points. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the president of the mortgage company. This email informed us that XXXX was legally required to close out the application and that we would soon be receiving a notice from XXXX  that would show that XXXX  no longer had an active application in the system for us ; the email stated that the communication that we would receive could include language stated that the application was denied, but that it would not impact our ongoing application with CMHL. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a Changed Circumstance letter. This letter added a {$770.00} fee, amounting to 0.25 % of the loan amount, as points, as part of the origination costs. This fee was not explained to us. The letter stated that it was due to the credit report/credit score and credit report/mortgage insurance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email titled XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Conditional Loan Approval. This email included a list of new documents to provide, including new disclosures, new bank statements, new paystubs, insurance quote, and college transcripts. It should be noted that we were told, in the body of the email, that the documents needed to be provided asap. At this point, we were not offered a secure way to send our documents. We could email them back to the loan processor directly or fax them. 

At this point, we were also informed that we could not send pictures of documents to the loan processor, despite having been able to send images previously. While navigable, this put a fair amount of undue pressure on us, as we had to find a way to scan our documents to be able to send them via email. We also found that we had a significant amount of pressure from the loan processor to provide the documents quickly On XX/XX/XXXX, we received disclosures to sign. On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed the loan officer and asked if the disclosures were the final set and if the listed cash to close amount was the amount we needed to get our cashiers check for closing. We were informed that the disclosures given were the final set. 

The XX/XX/XXXX documents additionally included a waiver for the receipt of the appraisal within the timing required by ECOA section 1002.14 ( a ) ( 1 ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the appraisal on the property. This property appraisal had been completed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed our loan officer to ask about what name to put on the cashiers check for closing, as we never received closing instructions. While this email was sent on a Saturday, we had previously received prompt responses from all parties, even on weekends. We had no reason to believe that we would not hear back prior to closing on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We received no further communication from the mortgage company, nor any of its agents, prior to closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we closed on the mortgage. Our appointment to close was at XXXX. We arrived at approximately XXXX, as our previous meeting for the day had ended more quickly than expected. We were prepared to wait until XXXX. Our closing agent came out at around XXXX and told us that our application had not yet been approved by CMHL and that she was, as a result, still, waiting for documents. She also informed us that she had not yet received the final closing disclosure and that, as a result, our cash to close amount had not yet ben finalized. 

At about XXXX, our closing agent informed us that she had received several closing disclosures for our application that day. She then stated that the final closing amount had been set by CMHL, as she had confirmed the most recent disclosure with the wire processor. We were short on our original check ( which was stated as the final amount, as previously noted ) and were forced to go back to our bank. We had to come up with about {$800.00} on the spot to be able to close. At this point, our closing documents were not yet available. 

We signed our documents at our XXXX PM on XX/XX/XXXX. We waited at the settlement office until nearly XXXX XXXX for the final wire to be sent by the processing agent. We were given no explanation for the significant wait. 

After closing, we returned to our then-current residence for the night. We checked our mail. We found two letters which were mailed to us ( one for each of us ), which stated that our loan had been denied. The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, but had not been mailed and post-marked until XX/XX/XXXX. These letters were related to the hand-off from XXXX to CMHL. As previously noted, we had been told in XXXX that we may receive a formal denial letter, due to the new application being opened. As given by the discrepancy between the letter and postmark dates, it appears that these letters were held back for some reason. The reason was not given to us at any point in the application process. 

The following day, XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from our loan officer apologizing for the delay in response to our question regarding our closing and a statement that she hoped our closing went okay. No comments were included regarding the fact that our loan had not been approved for the day of closing. We did not respond. 

In summary, the entire process was fraught and full of miscommunications and a lack of communication. Our grievances are summarized below : Our application was forgotten by the mortgage company, as the original representative left and nobody picked up his caseload. 
Our application was implied to have been complete and in process with the original representative. 
o At no point did we receive a formal notice of incompleteness, despite ongoing requests for information over several months. 
o We were not given a complete checklist of all the information that we would need to provide throughout the life of the application and approval process. 
We were not given product comparisons between available options, despite multiple requests for such information. 
We were originally put into a product type that we explicitly stated that we did not want. 
o While we do not know the details of the XXXX/CMHL compensation structure, we have been informed by multiple individuals from outside financial institutions that FHA loans often generate a larger incentive fee for the loan officer. We believe that this could be the reason for the initial assignment.

We were given contradictory information throughout the process. This includes receiving documents which did not include {$5000.00} in cash we had already paid ; while this was resolved, this issue was never explained to us.

We were not given explanations for multiple adjustments and changes to fees and amounts through out the process.

o Our loan officer did not make any attempt to explain any of the forms, procedures, or documents that we received. We were forced to make our best attempt at understanding the files that we had to sign. 
o When setting our rate lock, the loan officer did not explain the difference between the given options. As previously stated, two of the options did not mathematically calculate to the payments given.

o We are better informed than most consumers, as one of us works for a commercial bank. Even then, we had trouble with some of the documents and it is baffling that we received no guidance from the loan officer.

We were denied a secure way to send documents to the loan processor.

o Additionally, a format which had previously been acceptable for files, was no longer acceptable. We were not given an explanation for this discrepancy. 
We were not given closing instructions. When we reached out for instructions ( admitted at the 11th hour ), we did not receive a response. This is out of line with prior behavior, as we had previously received prompt communication even outside of normal business hours. 
o The response from the lender was given a business day after our closing. It should be noted that this response did not include any of the requested information. 
Our loan was not approved prior to the day of our closing and, in actuality, we had to wait for the application to be approved and for documents to be prepared and sent to our closing agent. 
o While we are not sure of the industry standard for loan approvals and preparation of loan documents for mortgages, it does not seem unreasonable to expect that the process should be completed well prior to the day of closing. 
o This caused a significant amount of personal stress, as our closing agent could not give us an expected timeline. We were left unaware of if we were going to be able to close on our scheduled date or if we would need to be rescheduled. 
This is significant, as we had already made arrangements for our moving process, including cancelling our lease with our prior residence, booking and prepaying for moving equipment, and taking time off from work ( including taking time for the day of closing itself ). 
We received a formal loan denial after our closing, with the denial letters being sent on XX/XX/XXXX. Given that XX/XX/XXXX was a holiday, it seems likely that the letters were sent so as to not be received until after closing. 
o The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, which means that the letters were held back for well over a month. While we are not sure on the required disclosure timelines for consumer loans, we have been informed that it is often 10 days from the decision date. This delivery falls well outside of that window.",,"ClosingMark Financial Services, LLC",CO,802XX,,Consent provided,Web,11/15/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3439091

Well, they reported it to my credit report on XX/XX/2019 without ever giving me 30 days to dispute the debt. They have reported debt to my credit report that they have not validated. I called their office and spoke to the supervisor XXXX XXXX, and she said they report it to the credit bureau within 30 days from the time they receive the debt. This is their standard practice.

They are reporting debt that they have stated they do not even know if it's valid. I do not even know what this debt is. She said she would remove it from my credit report for the next 30-45 days as they are working on validating the debt.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,327XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/24/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3416197

I reached out again today on XX/XX/XXXX to make this request via phone and was told initially to send the request that I already sent it too. I asked to speak with a supervisor and after being put on hold for about 30 minutes, I finally spoke to one. They told me that my loan to value must be under 70 % loan to value and that was their policy. After reading this document to the supervisor, I was told that "" they don't have that document on file ''. She ( XXXX XXXX ) sent me a link to send her the form I have. I did so and just told me that I'll be hearing from them in 7-10 business days. Given their past history, I highly doubt that I will hear from them. I did mention to the supervisor and ask her why they weren't staying compliant to the homeowners protection act and she said nothing.

I was the only person providing money in the purchase of my home. I was in a TREC   contract with XXXX XXXX for my home. It was already signed by us both for the home {$85000.00} financed for 360 months no balloon payment ; until I received XX/XX/XXXX closing documents showing a balloon payment due XXXX XXXX, payments of {$850.00} every month/ {$600.00} being the house payment and the other being taxes. I am wanting to see the bank statements and escrow accounting for the time period of XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX, XXXX and the payment records for taxes, and all transfer records. And the proof that XXXX XXXX has showing {$95000.00} going from her hand to mine. I want to see the substitute trustee recorded appointment and I want to see proof of XXXX XXXX identity. I want to see the accounting for the down payment made on the property and proof she owned the property when she sold it to me. 
When I obtained legal representation and stopped the sale date, another debt collection letter came dated XX/XX/XXXX for a sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. This notice contains all the same information as the previous notice except it is listing XXXX XXXX name first above XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney in fact at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX , Texas . After firing the first attorney hired after the discovery of {$21000.00} in receipts missing from my receipts of payments to XXXX XXXX a new hired attorney chose to conspire with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and in the printed emails left in my file that were my attorney and XXXX XXXX Attorney planning and executing the sale of my home they had agreed on the figures that XXXX will have the HUD 1 payoff Mr Cooper and XXXX loans paid in full their ( your, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) further states there is a first and second on this property Mr Cooper total payoff by XXXX XXXX {$47000.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX payoff is {$13000.00} subtotal {$60000.00} BUT again there is language of a loan between XXXX and I in an amount said to be {$78000.00} and Mr. XXXX took the liberty of adding Attorney fees of {$5000.00} making a total of {$83000.00} these documents were emailed back and forth plan discussed of running it through the uncontested docket, signed by a judge, filed in the court records, being fully executed. But I never received any documentation of this sale. I am requesting / demanding the pay off accounting and statements and a copy of the HUD1.

Now I am needing to have the documentation and explanation of how my home was sold, if it wasnt is it fraud on the court? And AGAIN I receive another notice of substitute trustee sale dated XX/XX/XXXX this time the amounts are base amount due as maturity : {$88000.00} / unpaid principle past maturity ( 18 % ) {$34000.00} / subtotal {$120000.00} / Attorney Fees XXXX / Cost {$120.00} / Total due XX/XX/XXXX {$130000.00} It continues to read : please contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for current payoff instructions at my address above please be advised if this payment is not received by XXXX the mortgagee will exercise the rights under the loan documents and foreclose the loan at public sale, Tuesday, XXXX, XXXX at XXXX. In accordance with the federal and Texas laws regarding fair debt debt collections unless you within thirty days after receipt of this notice, dispute the validity of the debt set forth above or any portionhereof the indebtedness will be assumed to be valid.

Now I want to know how you, XXXX XXXX XXXX or and XXXX XXXX can act as an Attorney in fact and harass me for months, years inducing lawsuits when an attorney in fact is not allowed to handle assets held in trust? How can you impose a debt on me of {$130000.00} and state you will respond to my letter of validation when you did not. Mailing me copies of public record court papers and passed made up accounting graphs from your home computer is not accounting. I want to see the reasoning on how you decided I owed this last mentioned notice and the removal of trustee documents recorded. You stated in this debt collection letter you would reveal the original creaditor upon my request and you did not.I mailed to you by certified letter and I faxed you the same validation letter but you not XXXX XXXX responded until I received again a substitute trustee sale notice this time 2 in the same envelope? dated XX/XX/XXXX And XXXX XXXX, XXXX stating I owe {$130000.00} and contains debt collection language but you are threatening to sell my home ...., you already did once. On XX/XX/XXXX you sold my home to XXXX XXXX for a credit bid of {$88000.00}.? I want all tax certificates and the deed of trust back I want all XXXX XXXX XXXX accounting and I want copies of all the escrow account. I want copies of proof you owned my home when you sold it to me XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
I demand documented proof that you obtained a legal confessed judgement by me. I demand documentation of the mortgage loan you have repeatedly made demands for payment of and of the investment contract you are holding / have held me liable for that I am not a party that is the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Statue of Frauds was made to prevent the very thing you have been doing to me. See UCC at 2-201. You have made me an undisclosed third party to a loan modification ; to a contract I am not a party to. This is why you have never been able to show my payments going to a servicing company you are sending them as cash flow to the investors. You kept using the term mortgage in your debt collection letters but a note is a security as you know, this was undisclosed to me along with a disclaimer that was supposed to be in the credit application under Title 16 16 car 433.2 which says the buyer/seller takes it subject to all defenses and claims that the buyer could assert against any transferee or any buyer who buys it. But you Took it out of the loan application. So there is no holder in due course meaning you take it subject to my claims and defenses I am claiming recoupment under UCC 3-305 under UCC 3-306 I am encoring my proprietary and possession art and property interest in the note and its proceds. Also I am encoring my right to rescind the endorsement on the note. The rider XXXX XXXX made the wrap around deed of trust with modifies the conditions of payment and supplements and governs the promissory note. UCC 3-106 ( D ) it cant be negotiated instrument if it is subject or governed by extraneous documents outside the promissory note and you made it subject to an adjustable rate Ryder and a deed of trust. You can not collect an alleged debt on what you call a mortgage and sell someones property when it is not a note or a negotiable interest. It has a maturity longer than nine months making it a security. I am encoring my right to claim under UCC 3-306 the proceeds, rescuind the negotiation, and am claiming my possessionary and property right in the proceeds in the investment contract.

In spite of this fact, she requested through the branch bank vice president that we submit our application and all required documents to her again for the 33rd time in 18 months ( see attachment ). Consequently, our dedicated relationship manager sent to our home address a XXXX envelope for us to submit our application and documents back to her again. We sealed the documents in that envelope and took it back to the Chase branch bank so that Chase employees could send it to her through XXXX. 
The Chase branch bank in XXXX, Georgia took receipt of our envelope of documents and gave them to XXXX.

04/15/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I am in the XXXX  industry and have been deeply affected by the Coronavirus, likely more than most. I am a XXXX XXXX as a XXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXX. I have lost 4 months of work and have even been rescheduling in the Fall and losing my remaining good Saturdays for the year. So I will not be making up that money. I filed for unemployment, but because I am XXXX and work in 2 states ( XXXX XXXX area strattles state line ), I was told I had to call in. The call line sends you to a machine which hangs up on you after directing you back online because they are swamped. So I said I only work in Kansas in order to submit it, but no response or check yet. 

We have XXXX  kids and a new home we bought in XXXX of 2019. Our mortgage company is Mr. Cooper. We have missed 2 payments of roughly {$1800.00} each, XXXX and XXXX, so far. I have tried calling, but they also have an automated message directing you back to online and hanging up afterward. But then I discover the only option is a forbearance, admittedly warning I may be disqualified from any stimulus or other aid if I fill it out. On top of that, they say quite sternly XXXX and repeated bluntly by the CEO in a video ) that it is NOT an extension of the life of the loan, but rather a normal extension, requiring a lump sum at the end of the 90 days. As if anyone is saving money right now and able to pay MORE when this nightmare is over! Thats illogical. It is mentioned that payment plans could be made, but this is not what you agree to in the application and it is so arbitrary it is unknown exactly what they could force you to do after agreeing to this form. This seems unwise to enter into. So for these terms, and the threat of not getting aid, I chose not to fill this out. I did however email them explaining this. I have not heard back and they are still not taking calls. 

We can not lose our home. And we can not pay a higher monthly payment. We are scared and dont know how to fix this. Meanwhile, the days are passing by and notices are flooding in. We have been able to pay all our other bills, but that will end this month if unemployment or a stimulus doesnt come soon. 

If anyone can encourage mortgage companies to extend the life of loans, it would help us immensely. I can only imagine how many people are being hurt by filling out this forbearance, which essentially gives zero aid, and only allows for a little time to then make their account current all at once, without any backpay to do so. It seems dishonest and taking advantage of many people forced to choose this only option. They should be held accountable for making things worse on hurting people everywhere.",,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE,KS,,,Consent provided,Web,04/15/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3607061

Capital One chose to place a stop payment prematurely on the check and in error, they will not admit to this error plainly, will rather state "" Expectations not set correctly '' as reason for stop payment. A second check was expedited via XXXX second day air and rep ( s ) did not allow enough mail time for prior check before reissuing and thus stopping payment.. The check amount, XXXX, represents the remaining balance in my checking account ending in XXXX. Replacement check was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. I left for XXXX XXXX on this day, was not at my address to receive/sign for it or sign check itself. 

XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX picked me up, drove me to XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I have a statement from Mr XXXX stating he picked me up on said date and time. Please see attached document from Mr XXXX, he can be reached at XXXX. I was in XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. 

I received information from a XXXX with leadership team at Capital One stating said check was intercepted and signed by a XXXX XXXX whom does not live here, cashed at a XXXX XXXX XXXX which is not my account and do not bank there. A XXXX XXXX with Capital One has replied in re about this, stating the person, XXXX XXXX, lives at my address and the XXXX XXXX Bank account is or was linked to my Capital One account at some point. She also refers to a check deposited to my account from this person sometime ago. My account is now closed and It appears Capital One chose to close it due to account security, they saw the linked account, which I am not aware of, as a possible risk. It appears someone had hacked into my account at some point, added XXXX XXXX account and also used my account to cash a check in the past. Neither of these two incidents are related to loss of funds or constitute receipt of them. 

If Capital One will check signatures on check received on XX/XX/XXXX and replacement check delivered on XX/XX/XXXX, they will see signatures are different from another. Also, another check from Capital One covering overdraft and return check fees relating to stop payment shows my true and correct signature, as does the check received on XX/XX/XXXX which was deposited to my XXXX account and is now closed due to overdrawn status. The overdraft is a result of Capital One stopping payment prematurely as stated prior. I've requested Capital One check signatures, XXXX XXXX did not comply. For argument sake and figuratively speaking even if the person, XXXX XXXX, is related, does not mean funds were not stolen from me as they in fact were..

I request someone in office of the President look into this matter which has been ongoing since late XX/XX/XXXX/early XX/XX/XXXX. To avoid investigating signatures as requested, Capital One chooses to mark complaints as duplicate to avoid doing so. They requested additional time to reply to a prior complaint, which took over a month and then turned around, marked it as duplicate.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CT,6320,,Consent provided,Web,01/29/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3136706

09/19/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,328XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/19/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3379394

I then did a little research on how to have errors removed from your credit report, as well as spoke to an attorney that advised me to send certified letters to both companies asking that the accounts be verified with proof of that verification. One company ( A collection Agency ) refused the letter, the other sent me a response that said they had verified the information with the credit bureaus and was not required to provide any proof to me other than they verified my identity on this credit card ON-LINE.

09/18/19,Debt collection,I do not know,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"On XX/XX/2019, I received the letter from Bilateral Credit Collection Company Which I have no idea who they are and there letter was written as XX/XX/2019. They were saying that I owe about {$18000.00} and respond us back urgent. They called me mulitple times and send me a letter that if i don't respond back they will treat it as confirmed debt and will make me liable. I called them and nobody picked up and i left them 2 to 3 times voicemail that please send everything in writing do not call as I am practicing the Fairness act of Debt collections. 
Anyway i send them a detailed letter as followed below in text. 

Bilateral Credit Collection XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, RI XXXX XXXX : Account No : XXXX To Whom It May Concern I do not consent to this debt and I totally dispute the validity of the debt in the above-reference account number # XXXX and would like verification from you of the obligation, the amount owed, and proof of a detailed valid assignment of the debt from the original creditor to you. I request everything to be send in written format and no phone calls or text messages. Please send me copies of all documents related to this dispute including along with the following questions answered. 
Q1 : Who you are you? Who do you represent? provide me a detailed contract copy if you are representing the original Creditor? Provide the facts and proof that you are the original representation?

Q2 : What is your direct number and what is the actual company headquarter address?

Q3 : What is your professional license information? Also are you registered in Washington state to send the dispute details as per law? As you are based out of state most probably you have to take retain local counsel?

Q4 : What was your process of getting the debt from the original creditor? what detailed information you asked or obtained? What was your verification process if it was actually a debt or a dispute? if you did not comply with the law to gather proper evidence of the claim disputes, you are already violating the law time.

Q 5 : Before sending the verification of the dispute, did you really investigated on your side what was the core issue why this all happened? 
Q 4 : Provide all the documents account records, invoices of claims and correspondence on what specific date?

Q5 : How you come up with this {$18000.00} amount and what is the breakdown of these charges?

Q6 : Based on my knowledge, Debt collectors signed a contract with the original creditor either on a commission basis or buy the debt for pretty cheap amount? By law and fairness Debt Collection Practices Act, you are supposed to provide all that information? How much was the actual amount you bought the debt or dispute for? Is there any documentation/ contract between you and the original creditor. 
Q7 : How can you seek verification and validation of the debt?

I am also exercising my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C 1692, and demand that you cease all communication except with me, my family members and all other third persons. Also you have violated the law of Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, by calling multiple times on different dates to pressurize and threaten about the debt when I left a voice message and left a message to one of your agent not to call on my number. Please send me all things in written. 
You are here by notifies that if you do not comply with this request, I will immediately file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and to the State Attorney General 's Office. If you are not able to provide the answer to the above questions and proper researched verification of the dispute within 15 to 30 days of time then you are violating the FDCPA detailed Civil and criminal claims will be pursued.

I can not pay this debt as I do not consent and I do not validate this debt to be considered as a debt. I am already going through financial hardship, medical issues myself and for my family, and on top of this bilateral Credit collection continues calls and violated the law when even told not to call back that have put more pressure and created more stress environment for myself. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX They still called me and last time threaten me to take action against me and report my credit collection right away which they did not. About 2 to 3 weeks passed, then now i have received one more letter from them to call them urgently to resolve as they tried to resolve this case. First of all, I disputed and they failed to provide me with the proof and validity and their connection with the original creditor. They threaten me also voilated by calling me multiple times then it stopped but last time they called when i clearly mentioned al communication in written as my right. Then they started bashing out and said you are this and threaten to take action. funny thing is that there employees can not take control of this small small tasks, how come a company owner saying i am the owner and i do all the work lol it is funny to me, that means the workers are stupid and not capable of handling an danswering and resolving and seeing the case. Why the owner of the company will do basic paper work job and call like a customer service that is strange to me. They also have mishandling and putting false claims on other people and there are reports on betterbusiness burea. Anyway i have my proof of recording of leaving them message to just send everything in written and they still voilated it. Also I have the recording of the person who said I am the owner and i will report it right away and shut the phone and was not even listening.They need to know they have to pay for the compensation and my waste of time if they plan to drag it further.

I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, the day I receive the bill to figure out why I am being charged. They basically explained that even though the last payment of {$26.00} was not due until several days after it was received ( I paid it before the due date ), the 12 months no interest program expired a few days before the payment was actually due. So basically I got charged over {$570.00} for a {$26.00} final payment that was paid early. I have excellent credit and strive to always pay my bills on time.

I got the loan thru BBVA. I set up online automatic withdrawal. I had problems setting it up online. So I tried over the phone. I was told I had everything set up online and all accounts, charges, settings were set. 
Well, after the first month, I started getting late notices on payments in XXXX 2018. I called and doubled checked my online account. Everything looked normal and already set up. On the phone, the representative would go over my account and said all was fine, it must be a glitch. And submit a work ticket. I never heard anything back.

Then 2-3 weeks later, I would get more mail stating I was failing to make regular monthly payments on my loan to BBVA. 
I once again, called and talked to a representative over the phone. Same thing. They said it was taken care of. 
In XX/XX/2018, I finally went into a local BBVA bank and said I wanted to speak to someone in charge and find out why my payments were not being submitted and why the auto withdrawal was not going thru. After 5 days, it was finally straightened out. BBVA apparently had the wrong account number from my bank. I had submitted it correctly, but they kept entering one too many digits. 
However, it is because of 2-3 months of NONE payments, I believe my credit history has suffered. I have a score of XXXX, as of XXXX-18. I believe this to be unfair since it was not my error back in XX/XX/2018, when BBVA made the mistake on my loan account. I wish for this to be corrected, reviewed and addressed. Since the correction, I have been late on NO accounts and fully pay all loans and bills on time with no past due or collection agencies.",,BBVA FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CO,804XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/10/18,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3096980

04/13/17,Credit card,,Other,,"I was stupid enough to charge some items at MACY 'S on my Macy 's credit card over XXXX. I was unable to log into my account online to make the payment because Macy 's had updated the system and I simply did n't have the patience to navigate their irritating and obscure system. However, I called Macy 's and paid my bill for $ XXXX a day or two late - was assured that there would be no late charges because I was a customer in good standing, yada yada, and received a confirmation number that I had paid the bill in full. 

I then received a bill for {$2.00} in interest. OK, I agree - I had n't paid the {$140.00} on time, regardless of the reason. Whatever. So I paid that {$2.00} bill immediately, by check, and left the country for an extended absence - in complete confidence that I had paid all my bills in full. 

Imagine my surprise when I returned to the US and found that Macy 's had received and cashed my check, but charged me a further {$2.00} anyway as a minimum interest charge on the interest charge that had been paid in full, well before the due date. Oh, and then added a further minimum {$2.00} charge for a total of {$4.00}, due on XXXX. 

I called Macy 's right away and spoke to one XXXX, who did n't seem to have a clue why I was irritated, but eventually - very grudgingly and with full implication that I was a total deadbeat - agreed that she would "" waive '' the {$4.00}. 

Imagine my FURTHER surprise when I received a FURTHER email from Macy 's about my "" account balance. '' I immediately called, went through endless voice prompts, and finally got through to a live human being who said in hushed tones that she 'd have to put me through to another department. 

Sure enough, I got the "" this is an attempt to collect a debt '' speech. The glorious XXXX, according to the faultlessly polite CS rep who answered, had failed to properly credit my account. He agreed that he could correct it and that my account would update eventually to show a {$0.00} balance. However, he was unable to reassure me that this, um, "" delinquency '' had not been reported to the credit bureaux that make a darn good living off selling my info, and he could not send me a letter saying that Macy 's had made a mistake. Given that the glorious XXXX had also assured me that I had a {$0.00} balance on my Macy 's charge card, forgive me if I 'm not confident that I do in fact now have a {$0.00} balance. 

I do not give a flying whatever about my credit as I am old and cranky and do n't need any credit. I DO care that Macy 's total incompetence and the Macy 's system that is set up to fail, to their benefit and to consumers ' detriment, affects kids and other people who DO need good credit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NC,286XX,,Consent provided,Web,04/13/17,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2432795

02/20/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"In XX/XX/2018 for about 10 months I made my daughter an authorized user of my account. Before doing so Barclay Card assured me that she could be a user and that it would have no impact on her credit. Only I was responsible for all charges on the account. She never signed anything. I asked for her to be added as an authorized signer to my account. BarclayCard sent her a card of her own to use. About XX/XX/XXXX she was finished with her need to use my credit card and I removed her as a user. 

She went to check her credit bureau the other day and found Barclay Card to be reporting MY full balance to her credit report. She called Barclay Card and they said they could not talk with her about it since she is not a signer on the account. I called Barclay Card to have it corrected and they said that I had to submit letter, via regular mail, and all of the supporting documentation to have my daughters credit reporting reversed. 

Their fraudulent mistake is not my problem to fix. Barclay Card acknowledges that they should not be reporting on my daughters credit report. They should not have reported it to her credit bureau while she was using the card and they certainly should not be reporting it now. However, they said they will maintain the fraudulent reporting unless I write them a letter with all the required documentation to have it removed. 

This is the exact kind of bullying behavior a big bank is supposed to have stopped a long time ago. So they have made an error and now it is MY problem to fix it. Unacceptable. And Illegal. 

Barclay Card has my complaint and my daughter 's complaint by phone and now through this correspondence. If they do not correct the erroneous reporting in a reasonable amount of time I will be forced to take more serious actions regarding the fraud they have committed against my daughter. Not to mention the illegal release of information about my account to her ( she should have never known the balance of my card at anytime, ever ). 

In my conversation with two Barclay representatives on the phone this evening both confirmed that the reporting should not have occurred as she was merely an authorized user with no responsibility for the credit and that the only way I can correct a credit reporting error, even if it is completely their fault, is in writing to a mailing address with supporting documentation which includes my daughter sending them, by mail, a full copy of the erroneous credit reporting. That exposes my family to unnecessary risk.

I spoke to the Fraud Unit at XXXX XXXX who put me in contact with XXXX to show that some Fraud activity on my credit may appear.

On XX/XX/19, I transferred some money out. I thought I already passed 90 day requirement. In XX/XX/XXXX., I contacted Capital 1 to check the bonus status.

Then I have to maintain a daily balance of {$50000.00} or more for 90 days following the initial funding period, which is 10 days. So even I have kept my daily balance above {$50000.00} longer than 90 days, I am not qualified for {$500.00} bonus. I went back to read the fine print carefully for this promotion. It states that "" Deposit {$50000.00} or more of new money from an external bank within the first 10 days of account opening. You will earn the {$500.00} bonus once youve maintained a daily balance of {$50000.00} or more for the first 90 days following the Initial Funding Period ''. It did not clearly and specifically pointed out that the initial funding period is TEN days, regardless when you funded account after opening it. I thought funding period referred to the time between opening account and funding account, as long as it is no more than 10 days. If I funded my new account on the 10th day of account opening and kept the daily minimum balance requirement for 90 days, I would have qualified for the bonus. In my case, I funded my new account on the 3rd day of account opening and kept the daily minimum balance requirement for 97 days, I am not qualified for bonus. The fine print words are very ambiguous and confusing. If it made it clear at the first place, I would have kept {$50000.00} for longer time.

I questioned him on the fact that the math on the PDF that was sent did not add up and that the principal balance was exactly the same as what I see online without the reapplied payment. If in fact they did reapply that payment then there would be a significant difference in the principal balance. I was then told that it was a programming issue and that the computer system shows different information online as to what they have in the system, I informed him that I am a computer engineer and what he is saying sounds very suspicious. I asked to speak with a supervisor who also argued with me about this imaginary reapplied payment.

12/06/18,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"In XXXX I had a mortgage with Cardinal Financial Company. My mortgage at this time was escrowed for both taxes and insurance. In XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced my existing mortgage through Cardinal Financial Company for a loan that did not have escrow. During my loan process the month prior my payoff was ordered. In that same month my Insurance was due to be disbursed from my escrow account. My Insurance was not paid out as it should have been as the policy renewal date was XX/XX/XXXX. I was not made aware at the time of closing or even prior that my insurance was not paid out of my escrow in XXXX and that my renewal for XX/XX/XXXX needed to be paid by me for the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX policy. This in turn caused by policy to lapse for 12mo causing me to have to purchase a worse case policy ( $ XXXX/Yr ) vs. the premium policy ( $ XXXX/Yr ) that I had. 
I reached out to Cardinal Financial Company in mid-XX/XX/XXXX once I found out my policy cancelled due to non-payment despite my account being escrowed. Initially I was told by the Insurance Department of Cardinal Financial that they did not get an invoice ( my further research found that was false as the insurance premium amount had been updated in their system to show the invoice amount for the renewal policy ). I was told that since I refinanced I should have paid it when my escrow was returned to me ( Issue with this : My insurance was due XX/XX/XXXX and I did not close on my refinance until XX/XX/XXXX - the insurance should have already been disbursed and paid by escrow ) ; I was also told when my payoff was ordered they netted my escrow from the payoff amount so all escrow payouts were froze ( I did not request this ) ; I received a letter in the mail this past week referencing my new loan and was told that their records show my insurance was good through XX/XX/XXXX and I needed to reach out to my new servicer ( False : They admitted in a conversation I had with them that they received a Notice to Cancel the day before I closed on my refinance ( XX/XX/XXXX ) - They still never said anything ) ; The last conversation I had with them they said that once a payoff is ordered they stop all escrow disbursements for 45/days and I was notified of this however could not tell me when or how I was notified ( I reviewed all of my closing docs that I signed and never signed anything about this. The only notice that was provided at close was my settlement statement that indicated I needed to cover my property expense going forward which I was aware of as I no longer escrowed ).",,CARDINAL FINANCIAL COMPANY,TN,371XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/06/18,Closed with explanation,No,N/A,3092493

Then two days before my signing date on XX/XX/XXXX, ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) they told me I would be charged a 1.099 % fee because my credit scores had dropped ( three credit agencies ) from XXXX to XXXX. I told them it was a mistake and when I called the credit agencies they told me it was because of a XXXX $ XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX bill that was unpaid. So I called XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and found out it was not my primary bill, but a secondary bill from another property and they had sent it to the wrong address, not my current address they send my other bills. XXXX XXXXXXXX sent a letter out ( which they never do ) to all three credit agencies to negate this late report. Within 15 days my credit scores all rose 80 points to back over 740.  Well I signed the paperwork in the mean time and when I went back to Ethos they said they wouldn't rebate me the fees.. 
First I think when they first ran my report to see the excellent scores and approved my loan they shouldn't be able to change that and charge me {$4900.00} two days before I sign the paperwork, just to hit me up with another charge. 
And secondly when I show they the low ratings were wrong ( shown by the letter from XXXX saying to delete this report to all three credit agencies ) and then two weeks later all three scores rose to their normally high scores they should refund me the {$4900.00} charge because the ratings were false reports ... ..

02/14/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Good Morning, Im submitting this complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX, because they reported 30 day late payments to the three credit bureaus on my vehicle loan. 
The vehicle loan account is in me and my husbands name ; On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband went to apply for an apartment and was denied due to all the late payments that where on his credit report. According to the apartment complex, the late payments showed up on Transuion, XXXX, and  XXXX. These are the late payments that are currently on our credit report ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX to get clarification on these late payments, because according to my documents I was never 30 days late. The first person I spoke with a XXXX   over the phone was XXXX and I inquired about all the late payments that were reported to the three credit bureaus. XXXX stated, I only see that XX/XX/XXXX, has been reported to the credit bureaus. Thats when I chimed in and said, According to the credit report that the apartment complex pulled on my husband, XXXX reported these months as being 30 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ). 
XXXX stated that she has limited ability to see whats on my vehicle loan account far as payments are concerned. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor, and she stated should would be it will be a while before the supervisor would be on the call. I waited 30 mins before XXXX the collections supervisor go on the line. He introduced himself as XXXX the collections supervisor. I asked XXXX, could he tell me what late payments did XXXX report to the 3 credit bureaus because my husband had his credit report pulled by the apartment complex and was denied the apartment because of several late payments on his credit report, I explained to him me and my husband are both on the car loan. XXXX stated, I have limited visablity to you car loan account. I said, You are a supervisor and you cant tell me what 30 day late payments XXXX submitted to the credit bureaus. XXXX said, We report differently to the credit bureaus, for instance if it the XXXX and we havent received a payment by then we report you to the credit bureaus. I informed him that was illegal because by law you must be 30 days late on payments before you can submit it to the 3 credit bureaus. XXXX is giving me this illegal information on a recorded XXXX line. He instructed me to send a letter to the XXXX direct dispute department. After he gave me that information, I informed him that I would be submitting a complaint with the CFPB about these late payments and this wasnt the first time that XXXX  sent incorrect info to the credit bureaus on this car loan. 
Please remove inaccurate late payments for these months from the 3 credit bureaus ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Also is there a way from preventing the month of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX from being submitted to these three credit bureaus Transuion, XXXX and XXXX. 
Ive attached a copy of screenshot from my car payments when I submitted them when I pay them via online. I dont have the screenshot of XXXX because it was in my old phone and it just blacked out on me and for some reason it wasnt saved in the cloud.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,750XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,02/14/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3152371

08/28/15,Payday loan,,Charged fees or interest I didn't expect,,"XXXX XXXX # XXXXAdvance Financial XXXX XXXX XXXX TN XXXXI have been a customer of Advance Financial XXXX for close to a year. I went into the office on XXXX XXXX 2015 to Pay may pay day advance and to rewrite the pay day advance in the amount of {$550.00}. I was told by the customer service representative that the company no longer does pay day advances and that if I needed the money I would have to take out a Flex Loan Plan. I was told that this would be like any other loan that XXXX % would go to interest on the loan and the remainder of my bi-weekly payment of {$67.00} would got toward the principal of the loan and that if I paid more than the {$67.00} it would go toward the principal as well to pay the loan off sooner. I asked if there were any other fees and I was told no. So I electronically signed the contract. I did n't read the fine print because no matter what I had to take this loan out my rent was due and if I did n't pay I would be evicted. If I did n't take this loan out I would have no money to pay my rent or buy gas to get back and forth to work or buy groceries!!! I feel like I was strong armed into taking out this loan because Advance Financial XXXX are predatory lenders who make their money from poor people in dire situations, the elderly and the uneducated. I received my billing statement for XX/XX/2015 to XX/XX/2015 and after paying over the {$67.00} bi-weekly payment for the past 3 months what started out as a {$550.00} loan now has a balance of {$620.00}. I am being charged a Customary Fee of {$50.00} with .7 % interest that I was n't told about and after calling customer service to find out why I was told that this accrues daily on top of the regular interest rate and the APR of 279.5 %!!! This loan is growing not getting paid off, at this rate I will never get this loan paid off!!! This company is not accredited with the XXXX and has had XXXX complaints over the past 3 years most similar to mine. I feel deceived at the least, these companies have to be stopped. I have no problem paying what I borrowed, and according to this billing statement I have paid YTD {$340.00}, {$310.00} to the customary fee and {$29.00} to the interest and NONE to the principal. I will pay the remaining {$200.00} but I will not continue to pay for the customary fee. I will not pay anything until this matter has been resolved. 

I will be sending a copy of this statement to the XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Department of Consumer Affairs, Federal Trade Commission, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, U.S. Department of Justice, FDIC and any and all other organizations or departments I need to, to get this matter resolved.

Moreover, per the attachment to this complaint Experian has stated that since I have "" previously disputed this item. We are not required to process a duplicative dispute.

By letter dated XX/XX/2018 ( Attached ) and a three subsequent letters dated XX/XX/2018 ( also attached, USPS tracking, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) I have asked for information pertaining to the verification of these items.I have yet to receive any thing other than a generic reply letter explaining the debt has been verified.

Our commercial loan officer was XXXX XXXX XXXX we meet with him at the bank about the loan in XXXX CT. We closed on the construction loan in XX/XX/XXXX for a 1 year construction loan with 2 6 month extension if needed. We started construction and everything was going fine. We had know problem making the loan payment because they came out of the checking with XXXX XXXX XXXX automatic. Due to changes in construction and weather we had come to the anniversary date on the construction loan and need the extension for 6 months. We reach out to XXXX XXXX early in the process to get it done so there was know problem with the loan. We than go the paperwork in the mail showing amount due on XXXX XXXX XXXX we were not done with the house. We reached out to XXXX XXXX about it and he said they were working on it. He would get back to us with something by the end of the week. We reach out again he said that they would have it done by early next week not to worry about it. We got the paperwork work late from them and than they put a late payment on my credit. We called XXXX XXXX about it and he said that should have not happen and he would take care of it for us. We tried and tried to get this fixed with him and XXXX XXXX also from XXXX XXXX XXXX she was our mortgage officer for the end of the loan when it was to go to a first mortgage on the property. We reach out to XXXX XXXX again after we closed on the mortgage to get this fixed he than at that time said to us that they can not fix it because they have an A rating an it would not look good for them.

01/16/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from chase stating that they are reporting my Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) as charged off on XX/XX/XXXX with unpaid balance of {$24000.00}.

They stated they canceled the balance owed on XX/XX/XXXX and issued a XXXX. and as a result updated charge off balance to {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and reported to credit bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX.

Further they state they carefully reviewed the account and did not find any misrepresentations, unfair tactics or tried to be deceiving.

And that they are required to report accurately.

The problem with these statements are my credit report shows a charge off in the payment history on XX/XX/XXXX. Then the next data entry shows a charge off on XX/XX/XXXX.

The status shows a balance update and status of charge off update to be XX/XX/XXXX when they clearly said in the letter the balance was canceled on XX/XX/XXXX. If the balance is {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX it should state XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX.

The next problem is the XXXX they furnished in the letter and sent to the irs shows an identifiable event code of ( F ) By Agreement. This would have to mean that I made an agreement with them to cancel the debt owed for less than the full balance. This would be false.

The date of the Identifiable event is XX/XX/XXXX. Considering the Irs regulations prior to XX/XX/XXXX. If a debt has not been paid for 36 months and active collection is not pursued then a XXXX is to be issued even if the debt is not discharged. The account was delinquent prior to XX/XX/XXXX and closed and charged off XX/XX/XXXX. A XXXX should have been issued prior to XX/XX/XXXX. So in this case the XXXX was issued in the wrong year with incorrect event coding Finally according to XXXX  county land records there was a mortgage assignment filed for this account. The Assignment of mortgage was not to Chase Home Finance nor Chase Home Lending. Which gives reason to believe the incorrect creditor is reporting the debt and that they do not have a valid claim. Whether the Assignment of mortgage is valid is speculative considering the notary had been suspended and the agent on behalf of Chase may or may not have worked for Chase.

My actions have been contacting Chase about the misrepresentations and they have stated the account has been charged off since XX/XX/XXXXbut it is still open and they are reporting correctly.

I disputed with Credit Reporting Agencies to validate the information which is clearly incorrect. The came back that they only report what they are told to and that it was validated.

I have submitted a prior complaint to CFPB which contacted Chase which responded with the letter that I have explained.

I have continually ran into problems getting credit due to this account reporting the charge off as XX/XX/XXXX since Derogatory Credit waiting periods require 4 years though the Charge Off had occurred XX/XX/XXXX. The cancellation of debt was XX/XX/XXXX which is not a charge off especially if the account was already charged off.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,IL,601XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,01/16/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3126827

01/07/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"During several dates, I have sent certified mail to the credit bureaus asking them to verify the inaccuracies of the information on the bankruptcy they are reporting. On my report, it lists the liabilities and assets being {$0.00}. This is not accurate and you can see this highlighted on the report attached. On several dates, I received the response from the bureau stating they verified the information. I then sent a letter to the XXXX County Court Clerk 's office asking if they verified the information to the bureaus. They sent me a letter stating that they do not provide information to the bureaus. The XXXX creditor was sent a letter for verification and validation and they have not responded to my request and have exceeded the mandatory 30 day time limit. XXXX XXXX was also contacted and has not sent verification.

My complaint is this, I challenged the Items based upon the inaccurate reporting of the {$0.00} assets and {$0.00} Liabilities on my report for the BK. Pertaining to the XXXX account, they have not responded to certified mail and confirmed verification and validation of their inaccurate reporting. The XXXX XXXX account jumps instantly into 60 day late reporting mark but does not say a 30 day period was breached. I have also added proof that these bureaus are not doing a true verification and supplying relevant proof while not flippantly dismissing the FCRA mandated rules. The bureaus also refuse to provide and form of evidence there for proving their verification. The Bureaus claimed that they had verified the information, when clearly they could not have for two reasons for the BK, 1 ) it is impossible to have a bankruptcy and have {$0.00} liabilities and {$0.00} assets reported 2 ) the bureaus claimed they verified the information, yet the source of the information sent me a letter that they do not verify information with the courts. Also, I put a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX report yet they used that agency ( NO third party can verify per FCRA ) as a third party.

This leads me to conclude that the credit bureaus never conducted a reasonable investigation on this inaccurate information for the BK. For the XXXX account they have not responded to my request for validation and verification and time has lapsed past 30 days.

In my certified mail I also requested they remove any inquiries that are not currently associated to any account. The credit bureaus also said they verified the information but can't provide any proof. If they do have proof they have not provided that to me after many requests.

I would like to have this inaccurate records removed from my credit report as it is reporting inaccurately and incomplete on my report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,761XX,,Consent provided,Web,01/07/19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3118512

I wasnt able to pay The whole amount back so they tried to ACH my account. It rejected and I set up to start making payments on the balance of {$580.00}. I paid {$280.00} towards the balance.

On XX/XX/2019 they sent in the ACH for {$580.00} to my bank account. My bank paid it in full on XX/XX/2019. They never took into account the {$280.00} I had already paid towards the balance owed. I called asking why they didnt consider the money I had already paid and XXXX told me I could just bring something showing it was paid by my bank and get a refund. Well on XX/XX/2019 I went up there for my refund. They refused to give it to me. They said they had to wait for their supervisor to approve it, or the system to let me have it. I called everyday trying to get my money back. On XX/XX/2019 my husband finally called their call center to make a complaint. The lady looked in the system she said your account has been paid and closed. She said just call up there and ask for your refund they have to give it to you. I told her I already did that and they refused giving it to me. She said they have no reason to hold onto your money. I will call the supervisor over that branch and have her over ride this. She said I will also have her call you directly when she gets out of her meeting. XXXX called me at XXXX cst she also refused to give me my money until XX/XX/2019 and told me how it was my fault they sent the check in basically. She even told me that the center lady didnt tell me they had no reason to hold my money. XXXX did not know my husband was on 3 way listening to the call center lady tell me this. XXXX also told me on XX/XX/2019 that Dotty didnt refuse my payment that I could of paid {$20.00} if that was all I had. I told her that was not explained to me by XXXX. On XX/XX/2019 at XXXX I went to my bank. I talked to them about possible rejecting the ACH. They told me it is to late they had already paid Advance America off on XX/XX/2019. They gave me a print out of my account showing nothing was pending and said take that and try again to get my money refunded to me. I did and XXXX finally refunded only {$250.00} of the {$280.00} I paid them. I dont think pay day loans should be able to send a ACH for The whole amount when someone has paid on something.

01/02/19,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I closed on my home in XXXX with Homebridge Financial Services. Everything was going fine payment wise until my family and I were affected by hurricane Matthew XXXX. I had damage to my home and my children and I had to evacuate. I had damages to my home, I lost power and my food. As a new homeowner, I was dropped from my homeowner 's insurance company, because I had filed a claim. Homebridge allowed me to make arrangements to pay my mortgage. Then in XXXX I had a loss of income and was not able to pay my mortgage. Also in XXXX, we had another hurricane and had to evacuate again and XXXX loss wages. Homebridge had me complete some paperwork to begin trying to make a way to save me from going into foreclosure. I filled out the loan modification papers and I believe everything was put on hold while I was going through the modification process. All the while going through this process, someone kept coming to my home creeping my family and I out, by putting a tag on my door with a handwritten note indicating for me to call Homebridge. I kept asking why is this happening when they know I am complying with what I am being told. Homebridge stated that they are aware that someone is coming out, but its protocol to see if someone is still living in the property, but they do not know the name of the company that is coming to my home. In XXXX, I was approved for trial modification to pay {$850.00} for three months. After the three months, I was told that my modification will be reviewed to determine if I would be approved. Every time I would call into Homebridge ( after my three months ), they would tell me that Im still in the trial modification and that even though its after the 90 days they are still working to get my modification approved. This extended all the way until XX/XX/XXXX. I was given a letter stating that my loan modification was approved to continue to pay {$850.00} and my new terms and agreement would be sent out to me and that someone would come out to my home to certify my documents. I received the documents via post-mail. The VERY next day these same documents were taped to my door ( creeping me out again ). I called Homebridge about it and really did not know why this would happen or who did it. Nevertheless, I contact XXXX they come out to my home in XX/XX/XXXX to notarize my paperwork and to send it back off to Homebridge for finalization. I called Homebridge after XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX to find out if they received my signed documents. They said that they did not. I called for about 2 weeks and finally they were located. Even with them now finding my document, I was still considered in a trial. Every time I called Homebridge about getting things finalized, Ive heard different stories about my loan being transferred to another company, then I was told that it was not being transferred. When I inquired about my modification approval been signed by Homebridge, they stated that they sent it out somewhere for recording and are waiting to get it back. Later I learned that the recording was here in my own county. I called down to the clerks office to inquire about the recording and I was told the only recording they had was when I first purchased the home in XXXX. I called back to Homebridge to inform them of this information and that I wanted to have my sign contract. I kept getting the runaround about the contract, so I later filed a grievance on the corporate level because I had learned once again that in fact my loan was being sold ; and that I was being transferred effective XX/XX/XXXX. I questioned Homebridge and ask them how could they transfer my loan and my business is not finalized yet and I still dont have my contract? After filing my grievance, I received via email my execute loan modification. I inquired about my payments, stating that I had been paying since XX/XX/XXXX was not being recorded with the credit bureaus. Homebridge informed me that all of these things would be taking care of prior to me transferring over to the new loan company, but that was not the truth. My loan transferred over to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX to inquire about my loan and they stated that they were not able to discuss with me fully until the loan was fully transferred over and to them give it about a week or two. So I gave it a couple weeks to inquire and I was told by the Representative that it takes about 60 days for my loan to be fully transferred over, but that I would not experience the issues that I had with Homebridge. They stated that it should be a smooth transition. This information was not the truth either. No sooner than after my loan transferred over to XXXX XXXX, I started receiving foreclosure letters and threatening letters from a company called XXXX. I never heard of them before, so I contacted them online to see who they were and I reluctantly created an account because I thought someone was using my name fraudulently. I scrolled down to the bottom of their website that I saw that they were Doing Business As XXXX XXXX. I realized that this was the same company. I contacted the company and shared with them my concerns and everything that I experienced with Homebridge. I asked if they are aware that my loan is being transferred over, why am I receiving foreclosed letters, threatening letters, and stating that I owe all of this money? I was told by my single point of contact at XXXX that this is typically their process. I was told that I would not able to pay my mortgage until my loan was fully transferred over to them. They gave me an email address to their Escalations department to send them something in writing because I wanted to request a letter stating that while going through this process, I am not allowed to pay my loan. The Escalations department sent me everything but I what I requested. As time went on I still was receiving letters stating that I owe all this money. I kept calling back because I was fearful of losing my home because everything was not fully transferring over from Homebridge. When I talk to a XXXX Rep, they stated that my loan had transferred over enough so that I can make a payment. I made a lump sum of {$1700.00} for the month of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( combined ). I told him that I really wanted to get this issue resolved and get on with my life. They told me that they can not do anything until they received contract signed by me and Homebridge. They said Homebridge only sent them an unsigned copy. I told them that I have a signed copy of the executed contract. I sent it to my single point of contact, she never acknowledge that she received my modification. I left her voicemails, stating if she did not get me, she could leave a detail message informing that she got it. She never verified via phone or email that she received it. I later spoke to another Rep that told me that I am not allowed to email my contract to a contact and that I needed to send it to Loss Mitigation. I learned that the single point of contact will was no longer my contact and I had been transferred to someone else at XXXX. I requested to speak to a manager at that point because again here it is again my business is not finalized and yet Im being transferred over again. I spoke with a supervisor who stated to me that it looks like the modification that I have would most likely have to be done all over again and that they would work get me a better modification amount then what I currently have. The supervisor also told me that if I was to submit the contract for them to honor the modification, that it could put me further in debt because only a portion of the money was given to them. She asked that I give her time to work on it. Meanwhile I continue to receive letters, but this time the payment amount came down. I received invoice letters for {$980.00}. I received invoice letters for {$1200.00}. I called to inquire about that and none of the people that I spoke to at XXXX  could explain to me why am I receiving figures other than approved modification amount of {$850.00}. They said that if I only pay the {$850.00}, there will be a balance and late fee. They see on their system that my escrow amount has not changed, they see my property tax hasnt changed. Quite frankly the property taxes and escrow arrears all were considered and calculated when I was approved for the modification at Homebridge making it {$850.00}. I was even told by XXXX they see an amount of {$850.00} as my payment. Where are these figures coming from? No one seems to know. Due to all that I have experienced, I am writing/filing this complaint because I am fearful of losing my home. My anxiety level is to the roof. I am having trouble sleeping because of this is constantly on my mind. Im unable to function properly at work and basic daily routine because I dont know if one day when I come home, will there be a home to go to. The point of this complaint is to have my contract honored. I am okay to keep my {$850.00} executed contract without penalty and be free from any other additional debt and/or bankruptcy. This complaint is to have XXXX honor my terms and conditions of this contract and to send me over to XXXX XXXX and remove me from XXXX Debt Collection/Loss Mitigation Department. I did everything that Homebridge requested of me for the past year and a half to get this modification approved. I should not be penalized in this manner and have the uncertainty of not knowing if I have a home for my children and I because the two companies cant get it together for the sake of the consumer. I want my county to be sent the proper documentation to put the recording on file that is necessary. I want my credit bureaus to be made aware that I have been paying my modification amount on time since XX/XX/XXXX. I know what its like to be XXXX  when I was a child and as a result, I had to grow up in XXXX XXXX. I purchase this home to give me and my children a sense of stability and consistency and this fear of losing my home is traumatic for me!!!

She is out of the country and because of marital problems she probably won't come back here. I tried to deposit the check in my account at XXXX  and they would not accept it without her being here. I also tried to open an account at XXXX XXXX but it was the same with them. I was assigned a taxpayer advocate by the IRS and she said that Chase Bank would accept it as a third party check. I called Chase on XX/XX/2019 to confirm and they did. I have them all the information about the check and they said they would take it without a problem. I opened an account at Chase on line later that day. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I went to a nearby branch to make the deposit. I double checked with a man I think was a manager to confirm they would accept the check and he confirmed they would so I made the deposit. The next morning I had an alert on my phone that my account was overdrawn by the amount of the check and my account was restricted and would be closed soon. I called Chase right away to see what happened. I was told that my wife would need to confirm that the check be deposited in my account ( we don't have a joint account ) and that they would not release the funds without her approval. I was told by the first few people I spoke to that if I could give them a US phone number issued in her name so they could call her to confirm. She is in XXXX and I'm not sure it is possible to get a prepaid SIM card I could send her, but the woman I spoke to at the CFPB said I should try. I have been working with a woman, XXXX, in Chase 's executive office to try to resolve this. Her number is XXXX ext. XXXX. It is urgent that I have access to this money as I am currently unemployed wait for SS XXXX, but at present I have no income, and rent is over due. I have been borrowing from family and friends and thought I would have the finds by now. I hope there is something you can do. I feel I have been robbed of this money. I was told they will hold it for 2-3 yeas and then release it to the state and I will be able to collect it as unclaimed funds. This doesn't seem acceptable. If their loss prevention department has decided not to release the funds to my account they should return them to me. XXXX is working on this, to get them to write me a new check, but she doesn't sound very confident when I speak with her. I hope you can help.

Unbeknownst to me, the representative I had spoken to reversed my entire XXXX mortgage payment instead of just crediting me the {$7.00} that was erroneously taken out of my checking account. Upon attending our closing, and our title closer speaking with the representative from XXXX XXXX and receiving the closing figures, we successfully concluded our closing thinking everything was fine. A month later I received a notice from XXXX XXXX advising we were in arrears in our mortgage payment. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX explaining that we had closed that account on XX/XX/18.

I told them to expeditiously examine the issue and get back to me asap. After not hearing from them for over a week, I called the servicing center and spoke to an agent that informed me I owed them {$2000.00} for XXXX mortgage payment. I said that was incorrect as I was enrolled in EFT which automatically pays my mortgage. I was then apprised with the fact that XXXX XXXX had reversed the entire mortgage payment for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX instead of crediting me the {$7.00} I had requested. I told them at no time was I EVER made aware that the entire XXXX payment was being reversed as I would not have allowed that to happen. They told me they would "" look into this ''. I also advised them that THEIR AGENT gave the figures at the closing on XX/XX/XXXX which indicated that XXXX XXXX knew the payment was reversed and should have included that in the closing numbers. I then went back and forth with XXXX XXXX for several weeks regarding this disaster speaking with agent after agent and vehemently demanded that no action be taken with any credit agency until AFTER a full investigation of the issue was resolved as this was surely the fault of XXXX XXXX. I was assured by a supervisor at XXXX XXXX that indeed no action would be taken. In XXXX, I was notified by the credit agencies that our credit score had dropped over 200 points due to late payments on our mortgage!

This complaint involves the following GR employees XXXX XXXX ( VP of Mortgage Lending ) ( "" XXXX '' ), XXXX XXXX ( Loan Coordinator ) ( "" XXXX '' ), and XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) ( Production Manager ). 

After a number of other mishaps during the pre-closing process, we were first told that XXXX finally submitted our application to the real lender this past Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). We were scheduled to close today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Despite assuring us on Friday that we were "" on track '' to close on time, XXXX and XXXX failed to disclose of mistakes delaying our close. They then failed to answer direct questions -- on Friday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday -- about when documents were sent so that we could evaluated whether closing needed to be moved and seek and extension from the sellers. Finally, at XXXX Wednesday XXXX -- hours before we were scheduled to close -- XXXX told me via a phone call that XXXX had mistakenly sent documentation to XXXX rather than the investor, XXXX XXXX, and that it lead to the delay. She then promised to provide me details in writing by the next morning so that I could assuage the sellers ' concerns and obtain an extension. 

On Thursday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a call from XXXX informing me that the information provided by XXXX -- which I had shared with the sellers as we tried to work towards delaying the closing at the last minute -- was incorrect. In fact, no information had been sent to XXXX. Rather, when the XXXX XXXX underwriter had returned the file to GR on XX/XX/XXXX, it had done so with a direction that the property appraisal be sent to collateral underwriting. GR ignored that direction until it finally sent the appraisal over to collateral review on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. This was not disclosed to us until my call with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. 

On that same call, XXXX assured me that there would only be a 3-4 hour turnaround once approval from XXXX XXXX was received because our filed would be in "" rush '' protocol for GR. Coincidentally, XXXX XXXX sent over approval by collateral review just after our call, around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX left me a voicemail that afternoon indicating they had received approval and would "" work on a closing for tomorrow on a rush. '' Despite those promises, as of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX the file is still "" in line '' to be reviewed by underwriting. The sellers are now threatening not to extend the contract. XXXX is backtracking on his promises yesterday, saying in a XX/XX/XXXX XXXX e-mail to me that "" I never once said we were closing today.

05/19/19,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"In addition to my TEACH Grants being wrongfully converted to loans in XXXX of XXXX, my loans have now been turned over to the US Department of Education for default. I am NOT in default. According to the most recent escalated rep that I spoke with on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were put in default on XX/XX/XXXX as a result of an error on their behalf. As XXXX, an escalated rep in the XXXX XXXX explained, the method by which they refunded money to me for payments made to grants, threw my loans into default. As she explained on XX/XX/XXXX, this is "" A big mess '', and it is by no fault of yours. '' I understand that the loans now must go to the "" XXXX XXXX '' and there is no timeline for the "" mess '' to be corrected. Meanwhile, my credit is trashed, and there is no estimated timeline that can be provided to me for the correction to occur. 
The numerous reps that I have spoken with since XXXX regarding my grants, Income-driven payment request, and public loan forgiveness program, have all given me contradictory information, and I have no faith in anyone I speak with there regarding my status on any of the above listed processes. For example, in XXXX, I had an escalated rep guide me through the Income-driven repayment application, wait on the phone until I completed the application, and uploaded to my online account. The next time I spoke with them regarding my expected refund for grant payments, I was told that the refund would not be issued, and that the payments would be credited to the overall loan amount. Yet, I was told in XXXX that I would be receiving a check by XX/XX/XXXX. During that same conversation, I took the opportunity to explain how I was exhausted from having to make numerous calls that usually exceeded 40 minutes, only to have to start over explaining the issues and repeating what I had been told on the previous conversation. Consistently, I was told that I was given incorrect information by previous rep. If it were not the truth, and if it did not cause stress, it would be comical - like a XXXX XXXX XXXX skit. Every rep provided different information regarding the same topic, even among escalated reps ( that I demanded to deal with every call since XXXX ). I complained about how it took 45 minutes and an escalated rep to teach me how to complete my IDR request so that I was not overcharged, and how upset I was that I had paid excessive payments for years because the application did not allow for me to correctly document my financial situation. In other words, I told the rep that the application "" baits '' you in to documenting income and spouse information that is not correct, but you are scared not to document it like that because of the liability you are subject to for filing false information. I told him how thankful I was that 5 years in to filing IDRs and making payments, someone was competent enough, and cared enough, to guide me through the application to get payment lowered where it should be. When I described that situation, the representative said that my IDR request provided "" false '' information, and that it could get me in trouble! I explained again that an escalated rep walked me through it, and waited on the phone for me to upload it and it be received. He said he can see where that happened, but unfortunately the rep gave me incorrect information. He said I could keep the payment where it is for now, but that I would have to file it differently if my husband and I file taxes jointly. 
There are many more occasions in which I have been provided false information and guidance, including information regarding the XXXX program. Obviously, Fed Loan Servicing reps have no accountability, and/or competence regarding protocols in any department. I have managed to get through, and have coped with the undue stress and excessive time and aggravation involved in managing my student loans, but default, I can not deal with! This is unbearable, and is negatively affecting my health. I am seeking legal advice. Thankfully, I have documented my calls since XXXX, with employee ID numbers. 
I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have worked at the same school, in the same position for 10 years. I pay my bills and am a law abiding citizen. Please advise.",,AES/PHEAA,AL,,,Consent provided,Web,05/19/19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3247132

Several years ago I had an issue with the annual fee with one of my other Capital One cards and a supervisor advised that they can switch my card to a Quick Silver card in which it does not have an annual fee. I am wondering why this associate could not suggest another Capital One card that does not have an annual fee. I asked if there was another card that Capital One can offer which does not carry the late fee.

I am sending this letter as of my final attempt to fairly allow you to do your job and kindly remove the errors that are reporting on my credit report. I've mentioned that i am a victim of identity theft. My information was also leaked in several breaches over the years but a recent one a few weeks in XXXX of 2019. Since it comes to my attention that you aren't responding maybe we should settle in court, which will work for me and i won't be wasting my time.

This letter is being sent to you in response to a computer generated, unsigned letter dated XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX ), letter received by Claimant from your offices. Be advised that your claim is disputed and validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt is requested in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692 and as amended by adding the following new Title 8 USC 802 et seq., and the Fair Credit Billing Act, 15 USC. 1666 et seq. All of which work in conjunction with each other, including the Truth In Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 USC 1601 et seq. It is not now, nor has it ever been, my intention to avoid paying any obligation that is lawfully owed by the Claimant. In order to make arrangements to pay an obligation which may be lawfully owed, please document and verify the debt by complying, in good faith, with this request for validation and return it to me, within thirty ( 30 ) days of receipt of this letter. 
This is NOT a request for verification or proof of Claimant mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION and PROOF OF CLAIM made pursuant to the above named Titles and Sections. I respectfully request that your offices provide Claimant with competent evidence as per the attached Declaration and Proof of Claim that I have any legal obligation to pay you the unsubstantiated alleged debt. Furthermore you shall cease all verbal communication. No phone calls to the Claimant. 
At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus, such as, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX prior to validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt, this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact ; if any negative mark is found on any of Claimant credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you and your client for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character Violation of United States Code TITLE 18 PART 1 CHAPTER 63 1341 ( Mail Fraud ) This debt is considered to be invalid until I receive proper validation and your offices provide Claimant with proof of claim of the disputed debt. Your offices have 30 days to produce the required documentation in accordance with FTC guidelines. During this validation period and proof of claim, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of Claimant credit reports, said action will be considered a dishonor and cause the self-executing contract portion of this notice to be implemented. This includes any listing any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated. 
If your offices fail to respond to this validation and proof of claim request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from Claimant credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to Claimant immediately.

Again, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is the crooked company who stole my family 's home at the auction, and is paying BIG money to Attorney XXXX XXXX # XXXX to continuously harass my family and me by sending us threatening letters, and phone calls attempting to steal our home and throw us out into the street. Of course this was at the direction of Wells Fargo. Had my magnificent Mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the account holder had been alive, she would have been XXXX years old on XX/XX/XXXX of this year. Wells Fargo, was continuously harassing my Mother when she was alive, threatening her with notices, which increased her stress level, causing her to become ill and unfortunately passed away a few years ago. My Mother had a lawsuit in place against Wells Fargo for unfairly taking advantage of her as a senior, and practicing predatory lending practices against her. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo was trying to throw my XXXX year old Mother into the street. Go figure ... Presently, Wells Fargo has teamed up with several of their cohorts to attempt to destroy our families dream. Quite naturally, this TRILLION dollar company is steadily denying any wrongdoing whatsoever. This is how Wells Fargo has managed to become a trillion dollar predatory lender due to the fact that this horrific company has attempted to steal the dreams of middle class families illegally, committing fraud for many years forcing middle class families out of the homes, which is why the former CEO of Wells Fargo, whose name is XXXX XXXX XXXX has be forced to step down by Congresswoman XXXX XXXX. It appears, however, that the general counsel who has interimly taken over as CEO, XXXX XXXX XXXX, appears to be just as crooked as XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo needs to be shut down, and many other class action lawsuits should be filed repeatedly, and dismantle this TRILLION dollar corrupt lender, until they file bankruptcy, which I am positive will be transpiring very soon. I will have the editors of prominent newspapers, and the eyewitness news to broadcast how the corrupt attorneys who are on Wells Fargo 's payroll AKA XXXX XXXX, and the infamous attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX, # XXXX in Cahoots with XXXX XXXX XXXXd XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who actually conducted the illegal sale of our home, and others. Wells Fargo, you need to surrender, and give my family and opportunity to stay in our Mother 's home, and not attempt to steal our family 's legacy ... .Wells Fargo XXXX al., Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, how can you sleep at night, knowing that you are destroying and dismantling families all over this state and the nation?",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,90016,,Consent provided,Web,05/30/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3257978

It continually shows the wrong amount due and incorrect due dates. Example : Login to the webpage it shows amount due as {$310.00} then look at the electronic statement and it shows {$290.00}. Consumers would be unsure as to what amount is actually due. Now at the end of the lease it shows {$750.00} due and no statement for XX/XX/XXXX. I called and they said I only owe {$140.00} ( which I paid ). I do not trust this company at all and I'm sure there will be more charges even though they tell me this XXXX 's out my account. This is very confusing and I have been very diligent to pay attention to statement amounts instead of the website but I'm worried that others would incur late payments and other financial hardships based on misinformation. This is very bad business. When I asked about this several times the only answer I got was they are working on it or they don't know why it shows this. I have talked to other GM financial customers who have similar stories. This needs to be investigated for predatory lending practices.

12/21/18,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with customer service,"This complaint is in conjunction with complaint XXXX. Initially I was unable to use my card for several months upon credit approval. Several attempts to contact hsbc and several hours of being put on hold and hung up on lead to my initial complaint.

Now, I have completed the online banking months ago as well to manage my account. HSBCs initial classificationof my account has caused me not to have the ability to log on, I have also stopped receiving paper letters in the mail showing me my statement. Since opening I have made one payment over the phone for the complete balance. However now I do not know the remaining payments or due dates which is preventing me to make my payment and ensure I have a XXXX  balance. 

I hurt my credit by opening this account with the intention of using rewards points, benefiting from the annual match of points, using my rewards points, and benefiting from the 0 % transfer. 

I was forced to open an additional card to perform the balance transfer, further harming my credit score. I am unable to use my rewards points because I can not log online. I have been prevented from using my card for several months limiting the benefit I would receive in rewards points and more importantly the annual match. I can not make a payment on this account due to unknown balances which I have never had a late payment and am afraid this may occur due to the mismanagement of opening this account. 

In addition to the hours spent already in the aforementioned complaint I spent additional hours trying to fix my online banking issues. I have attempted several days to contact customer service and resolve this issue. They continue to transfer me from to different departments until I drop from the conversation. Attached are additional documents of me attempting to open my online activity. 

In the aforementioned complaint HSBCs response rewarded me with {$100.00} in rewards points. This is an inadequate amount based on the harm this experience has caused to me credit score and the inability to use the benefits of the card which is why I opened it. Additionally, I can not use any of the rewards I was provided because I can not log on to my accounts although several customer service agents confirmed I opened my online accounts correctly.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,CO,806XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/21/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3106996

This is stunning, since XXXX  checked into my dispute regarding this account and removed it immediately. Both XXXX and Transunion, however, refused despite several phone calls and dispute filings. I do not owe that company any money. I have never missed a credit card or loan payment in my entire life, and these credit reporting companies have now reported an unpaid delinquent debt that cost me about 50 points on their credit report. I asked the credit reporting companies whether there is a judgment against me of any kind with respect to this debt. Neither XXXX  nor Transunion could find any such judgment. Nevertheless, they stated that XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed I owed money, and that was the end of the inquiry. I asked why my statement that I did not owe any money would not be held in the same regard as that company 's statement. But these companies had no valid answer. 

Furthermore, Transunion continued to add a suffix to my name that does not exist over my objection. XXXX  did the same thing. I disputed this with them, but only Transunion fixed the error. XXXX  refused, demanding personal information, which I was unwilling to send them due to their record of records ' breach ( which impacted me ). They stated  one company ( out of 50 accounts ) reported my name as XXXX, and they would take that company 's word over mine and that of 49 companies.  This was stunning, and to this day, the company continues to hold me out as someone I am not. 

I hope you can fix this!

I filled out a web form requesting a rate for a conventional loan. A loan officer contacted me and I gave him my information for a conventional loan. Much of the conversation was about him trying to get me to apply for an fha. I stated numerous times that I was already approved for an fha mortgage and that I did not want to consider an fha application. 
The loan officer stated that it didn't matter and that he could check on a conventional. 
After pulling my credit report he said that he could not qualify me for an fha for the amount that I wanted and I should not trust the preapproval 's I have received from the other lenders. Regardless that the other lenders have approved me based on verification of my assets and income and have been approved by underwriting. I said I didn't want to apply for an fha and that I would not be moving forward with their company. I filed a dispute with credit dispute with credit plus for the credit inquiry. The credit inquiry did not harm my credit score but the fact that this company requested an inquiry for a loan product ( conventional ) that they were never had the intent to approve me for I requested that they remove the inquiry from my report. 
I received a letter from credit plus with a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX through Credit plus from XXXX XXXX. The letter states that I applied for a mortgage over the phone with XXXX XXXX and that I gave verbal authorization for the credit report authorization. He further states I withdrew the application as they were not able to approve me for the amount that I desired. The truth is that I was applying for a conventional loan but the XXXX mortgage forms that they sent to the response has FHA checked off. In the box for assets it shows how much I had for a down payment and closing which was much larger than what I had stated I would use for the loan early in the process. Reason I withdrew was because that they were not offering the product I had requested I did not want to pay the fees involved with an FHA I could have increased my down payment to meet a DTI requirement. The false information that was being relayed from XXXX XXXX ( bait and switch tactics ) and I could not trust him nor his company is the reason I withdrew my application.",,Credit Plus Inc,IL,601XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,01/22/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3130643

This is not an account opened by me. The company responded in XX/XX/2017, indicating that I have not provided them with the required documentation, which is FALSE. I have been in contact with your investigators and have submitted all the information above once again on XX/XX/2017. On XX/XX/2017, I was contacted via email by Mr. XXXX XXXX, who stated he had not received the requested affidavit, I reminded Mr. XXXX that the required documents were sent to his inbox ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/2017. Mr. XXXX responded and stated that he required an incident report be filed as well, I replied informing Mr. XXXX that an incident report was not something I could furnish as per my notarized agreement with the Individual responsible, ( which I provided to the Lending Club ), in exchange for her admittance, I would not file charges. I have not heard from Mr. XXXX, nor any representative from The Lending Club since. The Lending Club has a copy of the signed agreement and all documentation, so I am unsure why they are requesting me to violate a notorized statement. 

This situation has dragged on for many years, and I am desperate to put it behind me. I am willing to work with the company, as I've always been, to come up with an agreement to resolve this issue once and for all. The entire ordeal of having someone extremely close to me cause such chaos, and turmoil in my life financially, mentally, emotionally and professionally has been tough to move past, especially with the remnants of her actions lingering on my credit report, military, and XXXX XXXX record. I ask The Lending Club to work with me to come to an agreement that is both fair and satisfactory to both, the company and myself so this situation can be put to an end once and for all.

My parents took it out for me to help my credit score for future events in my life. The loan was only for around {$2500.00} I believe. My parents then paid off the full amount immediately after for around {$2700.00}, whatever was quoted to them. Then just a few months ago, after 5 years of hearing nothing, thinking it was long in the past, I get a report from the credit bureau that my account with XXXX was delinquent, 120 days past due and that I owed XXXX dollars in interest ... I had no clue of this for the last 5 years. 

There is no way I would leave XXXX dollars left on my loan like that. ( Apparently it had grown to XXXX from late fees ) My parents paying the {$2700.00} was an attempt to pay them off. Thats what they were quoted and paid. I feel cheated by them. And now since then I have looked into it and thats what they have done to thousands and thousands of people. Ive tried to call them and get this figured out and its impossible to get through to anyone and when you finally do its pointless. The wanted me to get online into my account to get all the information there. But I realized thats a trick of theirs as well. In the fine print you agree to things that Im sure help them get by with it. Like you agree that everything we provide is accurate and true. I didnt feel comfortable with that obviously. So I told them on the phone I wanted a copy sent to my email of the payment history and balance history. So after 24 hours I get the email and once again it says, log in to your account to view your documents you asked for. I am not going to fall for their tricks. I just want a fair report and honesty.

Recd alert from XXXX XXXX of credit filing of delinquency ; contacted Rushmore. They said they never received payment ; I gave them all the information of the receipt of submitting. I've called numerous times and they kept saying they never received. Gave them the tracking # I had. 
There is no one else I can speak with ; there is no email address that can be used to communicate and deliver documentation. Either fax or regular mail. No attempt on their part to track receipt of said money using the information provided. 
rec 'd another statement dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating owing {$0.00}. Again I called and resubmitted the information regarding payment information ; they replied they had no way to track it, as they never received. Another notification of now the delinquency of over 60 days. 
XX/XX/XXXX - another call to Rushmore asking for assistance of tracking my payment and resolving the credit reporting. Still no assistance in helping. Therefore, I went to my bank and REWIRED ANOTHER PAYMENT. 
XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX CST resent ANOTHER wire transfer with an additional cost to me of {$25.00} -- Also, contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they have record from XXXX , Rushmore Loan Management Services received funds XX/XX/XXXX. Trace # is XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX - again called Rushmore to give them information that I just wired ANOTHER PAYMENT and was told to call back on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX to verify they received. 
XX/XX/XXXX - called and they verified payment received and closed account. I asked about next step in resolving credit reporting and also let them know they now have received TWO payments from me. Gave them additional information again for THEIR bank with a tracking # XXXX. Their records indicate a follow up is needed by me next Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

Asked them to report to credit agencies their reporting that the account was not delinquent which affected my CREDIT SCORE greatly. They indicated they would send to consumer affairs department for investigation however it is still under investigation. They offer no customer service to assist in rectifying the situation other than the customer doing all the calling ; following up. I was told to call XX/XX/XXXX, or I can mail/fax communication and wait again for reply. There is no other communication other than the one customer service line and you are unable to speak with anyone else ; no supervisor or anyone other than the rep on the phone. 

This loan was first taken from XXXX XXXX XXXX  and the account was turned over in XX/XX/XXXX to Rushmore Loan. In six years paying the mortgage for a payoff amount of {$0.00} this company has ruined my credit and is making no attempts to assist in correcting the problem. 

As of today XX/XX/XXXX, Rushmore has now an additional {$73.00} due to the double payment in which they can not tell me how or when the payment will be reissued back to me. Again, no one to speak with at all to assist in resolving issue. 

I have made every attempt possible to rectify the situation with no assistance whatsoever from Rushmore other than being treated like an individual who is trying NOT to pay a {$0.00} debt when I clearly paid a {$15000.00} debt I owed timely. 

I am looking for restitution of my {$73.00} over payment ; in addition to clearing my credit report of false information.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,RUSHMORE LOAN MANAGEMENT SERVICES LLC,LA,700XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/21/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3180696

You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,107XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/10/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3401646

I found a vehicle I was interested in, and a salesman pressured me into seeing if I could get approved for financing. I live on a fixed, SSI XXXX income so I was concerned about over-extending myself. They got me approved for financing, but I was still skeptical due to the high monthly payments. It was a Saturday, so the salesmen told me I could take the care home and see how I liked it. By Sunday morning, I knew this was something that I didn't want to do. First thing Monday morning ( the XXXX ), I returned the vehicle to XXXX XXXX. The manager and salesmen were very angry with me, and told me I had to take the car. I told them that I had the right of rescission, and was well within my rights to return the vehicle and change my mind. After all, because it was the weekend, the paperwork had not even been sent to the finance company yet. I left the vehicle at the dealership in their possession. I assumed the issue was resolved at that point. Over the next several days, I was overwhelmed with phone calls from reps at XXXX XXXX   saying that I had to come back to the dealership and pick up the car. I held steadfast, and told them that I had changed my mind, and did not want it. I had returned the car to the dealership within 36 hours and was well within my rights to do so. Again, I believe the issue to be resolved. To my surprise, the dealership actually delivered their car to my house on XX/XX/XXXX. I called the sheriff 's office about this, and asked them what I should do. They told me I should just take it back again, if I did not want it ; and that's what I did. I returned the vehicle again ( that same day ) and left it in their possession. Again, I thought the issue was resolved. Recently, I received a letter from a finance company called Santander talking about my interest rate on a car loan. I had no idea what this was about. I called them, and sure enough, this was for the car from XXXX XXXX. I explained the whole situation with the rep at the finance company, and they said they would make sure it was resolved. So despite returning the vehicle to the dealership before they even submitted the finance paperwork, and them knowing I did not want the car, the submitted the financing paperwork anyway. I can't believe the lengths that this dealership would go to try to force someone to buy a car they clearly did not want.",,Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.,NC,275XX,,Consent provided,Web,11/09/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3062009

03/01/19,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"In 2016, I was charged over {$1700.00} in overdraft charges after chase bank removed my access to mobile bank deposits. I have recorded conversations with bank employees, recorded with their consent, explicitly stating that the feature was removed due to low funding levels in my account, though no official guidelines were ever presented to me, despite multiple requests. My complaint is split into two parts : 1. ) Chase Bank utilized predatory tactics to remove mobile deposit from consumers who would most benefit from the feature. I was forced to incur heavy overdraft fees, many of which were returned when bank employees agreed that fees were caused exclusively due to the removal of that feature. After multiple instances when the bank agreed with my complaints and reversed fees, they continued agreeing but no longer had the capacity to reverse the charges. In one instance, when the city of XXXX was completely flooded and no street access existed to banks or atms, I was still charged a fee, even when I showed the ability to make a deposit as soon as the streets became accessible. Instances such as this occurred on numerous occasions, and each time employees told me that my feature had been removed due to a history of overdrafts, which was entirely created as a result of the removal, itself. This policy of removing the feature for customers with low or negative balances puts us into a purposeful loop of overdraft fees, which bank employees acknowledged as a known problem. 

2. ) I asked on numerous occasions to be given written or formal guidelines about my rights, as a consumer to utilize the mobile deposit feature. While in my recordings bank employees give vastly different answers about the terms of use, none could provide me with clear written rules. Who qualifies for that feature? When will mine be turned on? Why was the feature removed as a result of overdraft fees? All indicated that the feature was removed due to low funds or overdrafts, but none could explain why removal came as a consequence of those facts. Several employees agreed that this was an unfair practice and indicated that numerous customers called in with similar complaints over time. The second portion of my complaint is thus about the bank 's lack of transparency about customer terms of use. 

My recorded conversations with employees are from XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/2016, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, and XX/XX/16. In total, throughout that period I was assessed {$1700.00} in fees, though {$500.00} were refunded by employees who agreed that I had done all I could to avoid them.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,770XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/01/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3166742

01/12/19,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"In early XXXX, I ran into some financial trouble because my PNC bank account did not update on mobile banking over XXXX XXXX. This overdrew my account on the following Tuesday and because I was out of town and not working at the time, I had to wait 2 weeks for a paycheck to bring my account back to balance. I accrued over a XXXX dollars in overdraft and NSF fees and have records to prove this. I called PNC multiple times and asked of anything could be done to stop this with zero help. I was transferred to a supervisor department after the 1st employees claimed they could not reverse any of the fees as the system would not let them. The phone rang once and I got an automated message that said no one was available and the call automatically ended. Never called back. Accepting that they would not budge to work with me or help me at all, I paid the fees and brought my account back to positive and moved on. 

Fast forward to today. The company I work for has decided to switch to biweekly pay instead of weekly. These past 2 weeks on one weeks pay have been awful and stressful. However, we managed to make it to Thursday XX/XX/19 without overdrawing. My account was negative XXXX dollars on Thursday XX/XX/19. When I woke up on Friday XX/XX/19 my account was negative XXXX because of a few small transactions that went through and XXXX dollars in overdraft fees 3 XXXX  dollar charges each. So, my paycheck finally hit the account for XXXX dollars on Friday XX/XX/19. Then at XXXX on Saturday XX/XX/19 I was charged 3 more XXXX dollar overdraft fees after my paycheck had already hit the account. Because my paycheck has gone through I did not expect this. I have so many bills coming out this week from having to wait 2 weeks to get paid, that I can not afford XXXX dollars in overdraft fees. This is my whole grocery budget for the next 2 weeks until I get paid again and I literally have no food in my apartment. I called again today XX/XX/19 asking for assistance in this especially because my paycheck had hit and there is no reason for the fees to be met with no help again and told I should use tips to avoid overdrafting. Enough is enough of this. Ive paid so much in overdraft fees that I can't afford to live. All I want was the 3 most recent overdraft fees refunded to me so I can afford groceries so I don't starve without over drafting again and having the same thing happen while I wait another 2 weeks to get paid. I have exhausted all options to avoid this. I have overdraft protection on my account. I have alerts sent to me when my account drops below XXXX dollars. The way PNC does their business makes it impossible to avoid this because it happens over night while you are sleeping and then to offer no solution to a good, 6 year customer is frustrating and disheartening.",,PNC Bank N.A.,WI,531XX,,Consent provided,Web,01/12/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3123079

07/22/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"On XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX  notified me by email ( see attachments ) that my loan was being sold ( transferred ) to M & T Bank as of XX/XX/2019. I did not ask for this to happen, neither did I want to do business with M & T Bank, although I realized the sale was legal. 

The email notice said that I "" would not have to change any of the terms '' of my payments and simply continue as I had been doing, the only change being payments made to M & T Bank rather than XXXX. On Friday, XX/XX/2019, I received a 2nd email notice from M & T Bank basically stating the exact same thing. 

For the last 5 or more years, I had been making my XXXX XXXX payments through my XXXX XXXX Bill Payment System ( see attachments ). Payments were being made at least twice a month or every two ( 2 ) weeks consistently. I have NEVER made payments late in over 10 years with any mortgage payment and usually make the 2nd payment in a month ( prior month to due date ) at least 1 to 3 days early. My wife and I earn over {$180000.00} per year and do not have any issues making any debt payment!

At the time the transfer became effective, I had already paid XXXX XXXX  for the month of XXXX as I always due before the end of the previous month. M & T Bank sent me a bill not giving me credit for XX/XX/2019 payments that had already been made to XXXX XXXX prior to the transfer. Secondly, since I thought this was an error, I waited for a corrected statement. Instead, I received a pass due notice when my XXXX payment was not even due! 

I called M & T Bank on last Friday, XX/XX/2019 and explained everything above to the representative. Instead of assisting me with the issue, she kept giving me the run around and telling me that I had "" to change the way I was paying by logging on and signing up for their every-two-week payment bank draft ''. This was a direct contradiction to what I had been guaranteed in writing that I would NOT have to change the way I had been paying my mortgage properly for years. Secondly, she did nothing to bring my mortgage account current as it should be. 

Lastly, I just received by mail another pass due notice stating that I owe {$2900.00}, when in fact, I OWE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! The M & T Bank bill also included some {$920.00} "" Hazard Disbursement '' amount, which has never appeared on any previous mortgage bill, and they never explained it to me. 

My payments are current, and documentation is attached to prove it! If I were not late with XXXX XXXX, how could I now be late with M & T Bank when I have continued to make all payments twice a month or even every two weeks right through their transfer of mortgage process, for which again, I did not ask nor desire? 

This is absolutely ridiculous, and I expect the federal government to take the strongest possible action against this bank. They did not even listen to me or even try to correct the situation. I have been a perfect customer, I always pay all bills on time ( my credit score proves that ), and I will not tolerate this harassment in the lease.

Among those conditions were that a ) for primary residences loans, less than 5 years old require LTV of 75 % and b ) for multi-family residences the required LTV is 70 %.  They also stated I would have to pay for an appraisal. 

My mortgage disclosures from Sierra Pacific at the time of my mortgage closing very specifically state that my required LTV is 80 %, at which time I can request PMI be removed. The Sierra Pacific Mortgage website for my loan also states this 80 % LTV. 

At no point prior to receiving their letter was any 70 % or 75 % LTV requirement mentioned. 

I called Sierra Pacific repeatedly to address this issue. I talked the front line support about this and they would not put me in touch with the PMI department. They told me my PMI cancellation request was denied and that I needed a mortgage balance of {$440000.00} ( 70 % ) LTV to remove PMI ( my property is a two flat ). 

At this point I escalated the issue to a supervisor ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I was transferred to XXXX XXXX. He told me that he would reach out to the PMI department and get me more information in 3-5 days.

I was not willing to provide documents without more insight into what was happening or the issue being investigated. I asked to be transferred if a Supervisor but after waiting on hold for over 8 minutes -- I disconnected the call. 

I contacted the Capital One call center on XX/XX/2019 - I was routed through the auto-dialer to the Fraud Department. The representative was polite but unable to give me any detailed information about the status of my accounts. He explained I would need to provide a picture of my Oregon Driver 's License via a secure email link. Upon review, I would receive a phone call advising on the status of my accounts. I received the email, took 4 pictures of my ODL, and attached to the secured link and received a confirmation message indicating the transmission was successful. 

I contacted the Capital One call center on XX/XX/2019 - I was routed through the auto-dialer to the Fraud Department ( XXXX  ). I voiced my frustration about not receiving any status on the review nor a call as indicated by the XX/XX/2019 rep. XXXX advised no documents were received and provided a little more detail into possibilities of someone else attempting to retrieve or access my account. He did not or could not provide specifics. He sent me a new link to provide my documents and waiting on the call with me to confirm receipt. He was not able to confirm receipt since the documents again were not received. He was going to consult another party to confirm if there was a technical issue to explain why my documents were not being received. Then, the call disconnected. 

I can not begin to express to you how perplexing, concerning, and frustrating this has become to me as a long-standing Capital One customer. I may not have thousands of dollars of CC activity each year but I am definitely a customer who pays their bills and is paying monthly interest on my credit cards. I NEED someone to explain to me the specifics of the current restricted status of my accounts. I NEED someone to confirm receipt of my previous 2 submissions. I do not think it is too much to ask especially since it is MY personal information Capital One is requesting and asking me to compile without giving me any details. It is an odd way to do business and definitely lacks transparency.

There has been no verbal or written outreach by Capital One to me to advise or inform about the status of my account either.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,OR,973XX,,Consent provided,Web,01/30/19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3137137

During the process of the loan consolidation, I indicated that I was unemployed and submitted an app for an Income based repayment on XX/XX/18 ; along with the app, I uploaded my spouse paystub to my online account with XXXX as directed by a representative. I received a text message from fedloan stating In order for my Income repayment plan to be considered I needed to upload supporting documents so I called in twice, once in XX/XX/XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX regarding this uploaded paystub ; I notified the reps each time that I had already submitted the paystub and each time it was confirmed they could see the paystub.On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification the consolidation was completed with no mention of the income repayment plan. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another text from XXXX stating my payment is coming due on XX/XX/XXXX, etc. so I logged into my account to see why I had a payment due when I had applied for a repayment based on my unemployment. When I logged in I see a notice stating I needed to provide a paystub for my repayment plan so again, I call into customer service and the rep tells me it was denied because they didn't know how often my spouse was paid. Once I told him where to find this information on the stub he advised me he would resend the app for review ; I was never notified or contacted about this missing information until I reached out to them to check on the status. As of today,, XX/XX/2018 my account is now showing in a 5 day delinquent status. I sent an email ON XX/XX/18 inquiring about the status of my repayment plan and the reply back On XX/XX/18 stated it's still pending as of XX/XX/XXXX and not the original date I submitted it months ago. I have not been able to get this escalated and resolved with XXXX ; I am only getting the runaround about my account that I have diligently attempted to resolve prior to going into a delinquent status.",,AES/PHEAA,FL,322XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/28/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3112197

Sincerely, XXXX, XXXX SOC SEC # XXXX DOB XX/XX/XXXX ADDRESS XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX All furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies must comply with all applicableregulations. Information about applicable regulations currently in effect can be found at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's website, www.consumerfinance.govXXXX 
NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION : OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. Sections 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. section 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA is available at the website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. A list of the sections of the FCRA cross-referenced to the U.S. Code is at the end of this document.

Section 623 imposes the following duties upon furnishers : Accuracy Guidelines The FCRA requires furnishers to comply with federal guidelines and regulations dealing with the accuracy of information provided to CRAs by furnishers. Federal regulations and guidelines are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. Section 623 ( e ).

General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. However, the furnisher is not subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously specifies an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( a ) ( 1 ) ( C ).

Duty to Correct and Update Information If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must promptly provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute From Consumer If a consumer notifies a furnisher, at an address specified by the furnisher for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

If a consumer notifies a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ).

Furnishers must comply with federal regulations that identify when an information furnisher must investigate a dispute made directly to the furnisher by a consumer. Under these regulations, furnishers must complete an investigation within 30 days ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information ) unless the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant or comes from a "" credit repair organization. '' Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ). Federal regulations are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute From Consumer Reporting Agency If a CRA notifies a furnisher that a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information provided by thefurnisher, the furnisher has a duty to follow certain procedures. The furnisher must : Conduct an investigation and review all relevant information provided by the CRA, including information given to the CRA by the consumer. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

Report the results to the CRA that referred the dispute, and, if the investigation establishes that the information was, in fact, incomplete or inaccurate, report the results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain files on a nationwide basis. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( D ).

Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA ). Section 623 ( b ) ( 2 ).

Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ).

Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnished information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623 ( a ) ( 4 ).

Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer 's file. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information Financial institutions that furnish information to "" nationwide '' consumer reporting agencies, as defined in Section 603 ( p ), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA. Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ). The CFPB has prescribed model disclosures, 12 CFR Part 1022, App. B.

Duties When Furnishing Medical Information A furnisher whose primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices ( and such furnisher 's agents or assignees ) is a medical information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623 ( a ) ( 9 ). This notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604 ( g ) when reporting medical information.

Duties When ID Theft Occurs All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to notifications from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identified as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623 ( a ) ( 6 ). If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each CRA of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). When any furnisher of information is notified pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances. Section 615 ( f ).

06/28/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I have had the same conventional adjustable rate mortgage since XX/XX/XXXX. It started out with XXXX   was transferred to XXXX, then XXXX, and then the loan servicing to Loancare. My interest and principal payments adjust every XX/XX/XXXX. 

Loancare illegally accelerated repayment of the principal when it calculated my yearly arm adjustment and applied it to the XX/XX/XXXXloan payment. The on-line amortization schedule shows that the principal payments were calculated out to the year XX/XX/XXXXinstead of XX/XX/XXXX. [ Attachment-1. ] On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted customer service by phone and I was told that I should not make a payment until customer service corrected the discrepancy. I was told to email XXXX. That same day I sent an email. [ Attachments 2. ] On XX/XX/XXXX I was assigned Ticket No. XXXX and received two responsive emails and attached statements. [ Attachments 3-6. ] On XX/XX/XXXX I called customer service and asked to speak to a supervisor and talked to Supervisor XXXX. He told me he would escalate resolution of my problem. 

XX/XX/XXXX I also wrote an email to customer service. [ Attachment-7. ] I complained that Loancare had reported to the credit agencies that I was 30 days late. [ Attachment -8. ] XX/XX/XXXX I called customer service again and spoke to XXXX and then Supervisor XXXX. Again I was advised that making a payment would not resolve the problem, that the money would be put in a suspended account. I was promised by XXXX that she would escalate resolution of my problem and to give her three days. 

It is XX/XX/XXXX and nothing has changed. My amortization schedule is the same. My payment is doubled. I started working with a mortgage broker to try to refinance my mortgage loan but my credit report has to be corrected. The credit reporting affects my ability to get a job, the cost of insurance, and my ability to get loans. Today I wrote a letter to LoanCare Loss Mitigation, attached hereto and am filing this complaint because customer service has not resolved the problem as promised.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LoanCare, LLC",HI,967XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,07/02/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3290880

01/09/19,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I dont know where to start with this company. Everything started when I filed for homestead on my home. My realtor and mortgage broker advised me it would decrease my payments. I did everything I was told to do, by county and mortgage company in XXXX of 2018. I called Primary Resediential Mortgage 2 times that month for directions for filing homestead and then to confirm EVERYTHING was received. I got a confirmation that everything was in and great. Fast forward to XXXX when I get a letter in the mail that an escrow analysis was ran and caused my mortgage to increase because my property taxes increased to over {$2000.00}. I was beside myself, called PRMI and they said that I didnt send in the right info for my homestead and they found my property taxes raised to {$2000.00}. I submitted to PRMI my tax form I received in the mail showing y taxes were only going to be the high of {$1300.00}. I sent the them the confirmation and they re- ran the analysis and called me back and said good news, its going down. PRMI sent me a check said were all good, we wont run your analysis again for another year. So naturally, I cash this check and move on with life. 

Let me add in, in the middle of all this I had to speak with a manager because every rep I worked with couldnt do anything but read a script and understand the problem with my analysis. I spoke with XXXX XXXX which I will provide the emails sent to me from him. The first time I spoke with Jaes he advised would have to call me back the next day. I accepted. Well I guess that was the wrong thing to do, after not hearing from him I called back. The rep I spoke with said he wasnt in the office and he told her to just send me an email. Thats highly unacceptable, I demanded to speak with him. They finally transferred me over to him and he had the nerve to tell me that he was leaving out of town that next day and just didnt have time to talk to me. What a manager, I would review his status with the company. Well finally he sent me an email confirming everything was great the next day and what my new mortgage payment would be. Also, in this email he highlighted how his company provided me all incorrect information about my homestead and escrow payments and apologized for their mistake. 

To add to this problem I had in XXXX, I asked the 3 times about my homeowners insurance because I kept getting cancellation notices in the mail. Every single time they would say well look into it. I live in Florida, in the middle of hurricane season and they cant even get making a payment right? 

Well after I FINALLY had all of this settled I thought I could continue through the year without having to call this company. Well, I was wrong again. Fast forward now to XXXX, I receive a letter in the mail again from Primary Residential mortgage Inc and they said that my escrow analysis was going to be ran AGAIN and my mortgage will increase AGAIN! I got on the phone right away again and spoke with a rep who assured me that thats an automated message they have to send out and assured me that no, they only run it one a year and thats for next year. Silly me, I believe her and went about my life. Fast forward now to XXXX and I receive an actual new escrow analysis AGAIN raising my mortgage. I get back on the phone again and immediately ask for a manager. Well I get XXXX again. XXXX says he has to review my account and XXXX call back again in 2 business days. Why should it take that long, research now I asked. He said well today is over and I just dont have the time. When Im at work my day isnt over until I clock out and being as you guys were still in business hours I should have been taken care of. I accepted and advised okay call me tomorrow. 

The day came, XXXX called back. I spoke with XXXX and all he had to say was because I closed on my house on XXXX ( which I didnt, closed in XXXX ) they always run an escrow 12 months after closing. He then started to say that Primary residential hasnt done anything wrong and I just have to live with it. 

Well this is where I have stopped with this company. At this time, I just want to sell my house, refinance, anything to get away from this horrible company. It has been 12 months and I have had to call this comp at every single month since XXXX! A mortgage company shouldnt be able to raise and lower my mortgage at their pleasure every single month. Also, I shouldnt have to worry whether my insurance will be paid for my home.

( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general.

If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file.

( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.

02/24/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To whom it may concern, I am writing this complaint and addressing "" Experian, XXXX  and XXXX  who are three of the elite credit bureau agencies who ultimately has a stronghold over your life by reporting credit information. To begin I am very VERY disappointed and dissatisfied with the way that Experian, XXXX and XXXX runs and conducts business. They are supposed to by LAW report ACCURATE and updated information regarding individuals credit files as well as conduct ACTUAL investigations so they will only be reporting fair and ACCURATE information according to the FCRA. 

However stating these facts it has come to my knowledge that these Credit Agencies are NOT conducting business as they should by law. I have been disputing the item listed below for approximately 5 months now with no correct resolution which is removal from my credit report. Please note that Experian, XXXX, XXXX nor any one speaking for or on the behalf of each company can say otherwise due to the fact that I do send and retain all of my dispute letters and responses on top of me ALWAYS sending my dispute letters via Certified Mail. The item listed below is and has been due for removal for a numerous amount of reasons. Please also note that all three Credit Bureaus always CLAIM that they have done an investigation which I know is not true and the reasons are listed below for the creditor. 

CREDITOR : 1. "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' : To begin, This item should have been removed from my Credit files due to it being PAST the Nevada statute of Limitations, and not to forget to mention that with this creditor I have absolutely no ties with or contract with. Also I have the paperwork that this creditor sent me which is absolutely FALSE AND COUNTERFEIT ( also sent to Experian, XXXX and XXXX in a prior dispute )! There are incorrect dates that do not correlate with the actual information and reporting, The "" Date of Contract '' clashes and voids the actual initial paperwork given ( which is counterfeit, against the law and considered erroneous information which each company should have noticed upon their "" dispute investigation '' ). If you look at the "" contract '' that this company sent to me you will notice that on page 1 of 6 ( which they did not send me all 6 pages of ) for the "" Date of Lease Contract '' ( when the Lease Contract is filled out ) it states the Date of XX/XX/XXXX which is not possible due to the fact on Page 6 of 6 ( what seems to be the contract signing page ) states that it was signed on XX/XX/XXXX. If you look closely to the left side of this sign date is physically states "" Date form is filled out ( same as top of page 1 ) '' Which it does not. That leads and proves that this document is counterfeit erroneous information as well as making the contract VOID! Also I would like to point out even more erroneous and information referring back to page 1 of 1 of the document sent to me from the creditor. If you refer to section 6 of the document you will see that it states the "" Rent and Charges '' are a total of {$790.00} for the total lease period. Now if you will refer to the document with the Header "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) '' noted below to the right it gives a list of all dates and amounts ( which again clashes, voids and proves that XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as the credit bureaus are reporting false information. ). This brings me to point out the incorrect information on this document in regards to my credit file. My move in date on this document states I moved in XX/XX/XXXX and my "" Lease End Date '' was XX/XX/XXXX with my rent being {$970.00}. Also please be aware that if and as shown that my Lease date ended on XX/XX/XXXX how is it possible that this creditor is showing on my credit report with an opened date of XX/XX/XXXX on Experian and XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX when I had already moved out? The answer is it's not. Everything about this item on my credit is totally bogus, out of the Statute of limitations, erroneous and counterfeit information and needs to be removed. Nothing matches and some how it is still being reported on my Credit reports which is absolutely unacceptable.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NV,890XX,,Consent provided,Web,02/24/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3161288

Experian, XXXX XXXX and XXXX. I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The response from Experian and XXXX was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. 
I wrote Experian and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only Experian wrote back a letter dated XXXX stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. 

XXXX XXXX never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with XXXX, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. 

Please investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected. No I dont have to fight because Experian, XXXX  and XXXX XXXX all lied and said that XXXX verified and account which is impossible because my account with them is FROZEN and no one can access it but I. I demand that these items on my account that was not verified be removed from my account because they are in violation of my rights and not to mention, XXXX XXXX did not even respond to my investigation request.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NY,109XX,,Consent provided,Web,07/08/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3299386

I have formally disputed the charge, as I do not agree that XXXX XXXX    XXXX should have sent any bill at all. I have always paid all my bills, and of much larger amounts.I keep getting calls, and I have repeatedly requested agents from Capital Accounts to stop calling me. However, they keep calling, and are rude, and it seems their only goal is to harass me. Here is a brief summary : 1. I have a child with XXXX XXXX, and it takes specialized experience in dealing with such children to be able to Consult and treat them 2. When I took my daughter ( my son 's sister ) for her annual exam, I inquired at the office, and they informed me that their doctors have experience and will be able to examine my son 3. When I visited them with my son, the doctor was unable to do any exam on my  son and finally gave up saying he needs to be examined under XXXX. 
4. They handed me a 'treatment plan ' that required me to pay thousands of dollars. 
5. Subsequently, they sent me a bill saying that since they were not able to do a comprehensive exam ( which is covered by insurance ), they called it a limited exam. My point was that the doctor never really examined the child at all - and the doctor clearly had no experience dealing with Children with XXXX XXXX. Something the office made me believe to set me up for the appointment. 

In light of the above, the charges on this bill are fraudulent, and I should not owe them.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Capital Accounts, LLC",TX,750XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/06/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3171391

I called the Bank which was Chase and ask about it, the agent told me that all my credit cards from Chase were closed and that no information can be disclosed until I will receive a letter about it. 
I had 5 chase credit card, the Chase Business Ink, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, the Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Chase Hyatt Credit card, and the Chase Ihg credit card. In addition, my wife that was an authorized user on one of my cards, got her only card closed ( the Chase Sapphire Preferred card ). 
Chase claim was that I was requesting too many credit cards in a short time and that was a payment made from another company once. 
Although I had these 5 cards with Chase, they were open over a long period of time ( 4 years ) and they had different purposes. I always paid my bills on time and never had high spending on those cards. My incomes were high enough to justify all the credit limit I had. 
I did pay off once my balance with a check from a company, this was because I had a contract with them and some of my expenses that occurred during my work with them were paid with my personal credit card. It was normal to reimburse these expenses directly from the company 's check. 
I called Chase many time and spoke with many representatives but no one was able to help me with this.

They told it me it was because funds in my account went down, however, if they were monitoring my account, the could have been avoided prior to accepting a contract that I had submitted. Not only did they review and accept the contract, they had me, complete an inspection, secure an attorney, and purchase a condo questionnaire. My realtor sent emails to ensure that we were on track and we never got a no. There have been so many complaints online regarding naca but I still tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. There lack of responsiveness and perceived lack of care frustrated both my realtor and attorney. There has been constant mixed messages and doesnt seem like this program has any empathy for their clients. They seem to be preying on neighborhood clients versus helping them. Even after denying me, they still proceeded to take out fraudulent membership dues and money for a credit report. If you deny me of a loan I get approved for by the alternate lenders in 5 min. I sent a complaint to XXXX  and NACA for a refund of the fees over the last year and they denied me again. They dont think there is anything wrong with there process and the offered no help at all instead went back and forth with me in an email war to try and prove he was right without even picking up the phone to talk to me. This is the second time that naca nearly caused me to lose a home. The first offer I submitted, was denied by the seller because they didnt want to work with naca due to a reputation of the process taking too long. They asked me to switch  lenders and they would consider. Believing in naca, I stayed the course until I realized they werent really trying to help me. They never even offered an alternate solution.

03/13/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"SPS 2nd : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Before we begin it is important to note that SPS services both the 1st and 2nd loans on this property, and that they belong to different investors, with differing guidelines, that are in conflict with one another. This creates many problems when it comes to short sales, or any other type of negotiation, as they can not best protect either investor in a situation where the demands from each investor require the other to lower their net proceeds. SPS does not allow a prospective buyer to bring in additional monies to satisfy a demand from a junior lien holder, and in the State of California, a seller is never allowed to contribute any monies to satisfy demands. So that means the offer on the table is the only amount of money we have to work with to satisfy all liens on a property. 

The time line below shows the level of gross incompetence and possible purposeful negligence of the underwriting department in the review for loss mitigation on BOTH loans for this property. I have highlighted with *** the particularly problematic issues and communications. They have 2 sets of rules that are in direct conflict with one another. They should have known that there was no way for them to work out this loss mitigation file. 

XX/XX/XXXX Submitted to SPS offer was {$430000.00} XX/XX/XXXX Got value back of XXXX. We were asked to increase the net but not told what they required. 

XX/XX/XXXX Called the SPS Ombudsman to see if they could find out what the minimum required net is, and they were unable to tell me. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We sent market comps and an inspection report to support our offer of XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Rep at ombudsmans office said we were about 6k off minimum net required. We revised the HUD to reflect an increase to the net proceeds to the 1st trust deed by XXXX and sent that back to SPS XX/XX/XXXX Per Ombudsman, no response to our higher net. 

XX/XX/XXXX Called ombudsman, no response. Ombudsman sent message to underwriting to please get response XXXX Per the Ombudsman, underwriting somehow managed to close the review on XXXX yet the ombudsman never got notice of that, and wasn't apparent in the database. Instead, underwriting approved the XXXX 's for a repayment plan. The ombudsman can do NOTHING until one of the XXXX 's call in to decline that repayment on a recorded line. they can call the ombudsman to do so, to make sure it gets done right. we need to send all short and offer docs again to both XXXX and XXXX along with a letter requesting rush review due to us thinking we were in review for an entire month and no one ever told us we weren't. 

XX/XX/XXXX Resubmitted entire file and the homeowner called the ombudsman to decline payment plan that was never requested. 

XX/XX/XXXX Per XXXX in the Ombudsman department, the underwriter on the 1st denied the offer again wanting a further increased net. Yet again, they refused to provide us what net they wanted, making this a very frustrating guessing game for the buyers and the sellers. 

XX/XX/XXXX We increased the net again, and resubmitted the new offer. 

XX/XX/XXXX Underwriting for the 2nd demanded a corrected RMA and we sent that back on the same day XX/XX/XXXX Ombudsman told us that both loans were active in short sale review. 

XX/XX/XXXX We were told it looked like the 1st and 2nd were negotiating between each other and to expect decision by XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Finally got word that the investor for the 1st Trust Deed approved the short sale and that now the file can go to the investor to the 2nd for approval. As is normal for ALL short sales we do with SPS, the net to the 2nd was {$8500.00}. It is important to note here, that SPS never allows more than XXXX to go to a junior lien on any short sale, except in some GSE situations where the guidelines state the maximum is XXXX. We were told by SPS that they had internally approved the 2nd and just needed investor signoff. 
XXXX We were now told that the 2nd is requiring no less than 25,000 to approve the short sale, on a loan of XXXX. This is where the conflict of interest comes into play when the same company is servicing the 1st and 2nd for different investors. In NO short sale would SPS ever allow 30 % of the UPB to go to a 2nd when the 1st is still short. We were asked to revise the HUD showing XXXX to the 2nd. At that point I informed the Ombudsman that I believe we would then have a problem with the 1st, as we had already been fighting over meeting their net proceeds and per their investors policy of not allowing any 3rd party including the buyer or agents to contribute to satisfy junior liens, and the State of Californias law that sellers may not contribute in a short sale, this would then result in a substantial decrease to the net on the 1st. Ombudsman still asked us to send the HUD showing increased net to the 2nd, and decreased net to the 1st. We sent it same day. 

XXXX Ombudsman confirmed receipt of new HUD and attached it to both accounts. 

XXXX Ombudsman escalated issue again for resolution on the issues with both the 1st and 2nd nets. 
**** At this point I started calling twice a day for updates**** XX/XX/XXXX Still nothing back explained to ombudsman that based on the 1st TD approval letter and the verbal that the 2nd had been internally approved, that the buyer started working on their loan. Now their rate lock is expiring and asked them to please escalate again. Was told that they would attempt to escalate this to the highest level of management to get it going. Was also reassured that the issues for the 1st and the 2nd were escalated and tied together. 

XXXX Was told investor for 2nd has approved the file, but it needed to go through QC and there was nothing they could do regarding the net issues for the 1st until the letter for the 2nd had been issued even though we had been told repeatedly that they were escalated TOGETHER. 

XX/XX/XXXX Was told that the ombudsman had this escalated to the highest level and they send a message to find out what was taking so long. 

XX/XX/XXXX. Was told by ombudsman department that it had notes in the system for the 2nd from the 8th that it was being worked on by XXXX. 

XXXX Was told by ombudsman that this had only been sent to QC on the XXXX. We asked how that could possibly be the case and referenced our previous notes, we were then told it had failed QC on the XXXX but there were no notes as to why and that it was sent back to QC on the XXXX and escalated again. 

XXXX. Was told that the 2nd TD NEVER SENT THE FILE TO THE INVESTOR. They had NO EXPLANATION about all the times I was told it was approved and the approval letter was in the QC department. At this point it is obvious that we have been lied to throughout the entire process with SPSs 2nd TD department. ************Keep in mind we started this short sale with SPS on XX/XX/XXXX, so we have been LIED TO FOR OVER FOUR MONTHS. They have harmed not only their own investor ( s ) and their borrower, but also the buyer as they are preventing them from finding another property in this difficult market. 

I want SPS fined to the maximum amount allowed by law, I want the conflict of interest investigated and I want the short sale approved AS IT STANDS for both the 1st and the 2nd liens and I want SPS to be required to make up the difference for their investors.

These debts are not mine, yet they appear on my credit bureau file ( s ) as charged off debts. 

The XXXX XXXX account appears with a balance due of {$150.00}. I have never had an account with this organization. The XXXX XXXX XXXX account appears on my credit bureau file ( s ) as an Unsecured loan account with a charged off balance of {$410.00}. I have never obtained a loan from this organization and based on the corporate description, was unaware that they offered such services. 

In correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX ; I requested proof of my obligation to pay from both of these organizations. They responded with a letter requesting that I send them a police report for identity theft. I responded with a second letter dated XX/XX/XXXX again requesting validation in the form of ANY application for an account for credit or a contract bearing my signature. They both responded on XX/XX/XXXX with a print out of a bill ; which according to an FTC opinion letter is NOT sufficient proof that a debt belongs to a particular individual. 

According to the FCRA these debts have not been proven to belong to me and should therefore be removed from all 3 credit reporting agencies files. Subsequent requests for the same have not been honored by the credit bureas or by either of these organizations. The credit bureaus continue to report these debts as mine and I have also requested thier Method of Verification for these debts which they have yet to provide.

The negative balance associated with this account was well over {$1000.00}. I was fully unaware of the negative status of this account, and certainly had no idea that it had been charged off. I am still unsure of how it is legal for a bank to allow such an excessive charge to pass through, when there is no money in said account. In the terms of our divorce decree, it is stipulated that any and all debts incurred during the time of our legal separation are the financial responsibility of the party who acquired them. These charges were incurred solely by my ex-husband, and the bank associate even confirmed that it was clear to her, that the only debit card in use was his own personal card. Mine was entirely inactive. Even after calling in and pleading my case with the bank and offering to provide proof in the form of divorce documents, there was no consideration made to removing me from the liability of this debt. This debt affects me in two critical ways : I am unable to obtain any new bank accounts in the future until this debt is fully paid, and secondly, it is strongly impacting my credit score in a negative way. As a now single mother, I simply can not afford to pay for the gross financial irresponsibility of my ex-husband. That being the case, I feel XXXX should reconsider my request to remove my financial liability from this account, and the continuing mark on my credit, and be satisfied in pursuing XXXX XXXX for his debt.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,WA,,,Consent provided,Web,12/09/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3095510

12/28/18,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"In XXXX I purchased a condo and the original creditor was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I took out two mortgages for the condo at 80 % on first and 20 % on second. XXXX XXXX was an operating sub of XXXX and both were taken over by Bank of America in XXXX. 

In XXXX I was contacted by Bank of America via mail that I was eligible for loan modifications under the HAMP program. I contacted the using the number on the letter. The agent that I spoke to informed me that I would be eligible but first I needed to quit paying my mortgages. She stated that I needed to contact her in 3 months after non-payment. 

In three months the agent informed me that she would be sending out a modification package in the mail. Upon receiving it I filled it out and she informed me to continue to not pay my mortgages. Several months later in XXXX I received my modification package. The principal on the mortgage was {$110000.00} which was XXXX higher than the original 1st. I asked the agent about the 2nd mortgage and if I would be getting another bill. She replied that as far as she was concerned the 2nd was finished and that I was to ignore any and all bills for the property except the one sent by bank of america. She additionally stated that I would be receiving information in the future settling the 2nd mortgage and that it was going to be extinguished and discharged. She stated that I would be receiving a XXXX for the difference if there was one. 

During the modification process all financial adjustments and payments were reported on bills that were consistent with the XXXX XXXX XXXX statements. Upon completion of the trial period and upon transferring over to bank of america bills for the mortgage I received a statement from XXXX XXXX with regards to the 2nd mortgage that showed that the balance was adjusted to XXXX. It was dated in conjunction to the billing reflected on the first mortgage and the bank of america modification. 

I never received any bill with regard to the 2nd mortgage after the modification was completed. 3-4 years later I received a bill in the mail from a third party company that has been trying to collect. I emphatically deny the legitimacy of this debt. 

At the recorder of deeds it shows that the deed of trust assignment for the first mortgage was transferred to bank of america in XXXX of XXXX yet the 2nd mortgage has remained unchanged since XXXX. 

Upon conducting a title search it is clear that bank of america owns the 2nd mortgage still. I have tried to reach out via phone and email to bank of america only to get canned responses. 

I understand that in the early days of HAMP bank of america was contracting with third party companies to administrate the modifications. I also understand that these companies had poorly trained staff. I speculate that it is quit possible that while the third party organized the information and handed it back to bank of america that it is likely that the documentation was lost or incorrectly filed and that the 2nd mortgage was sold as an unsecured debt to a third party. 

I understand that in XXXX there was a settlement with the department of justice in which bank of america had to correct and amend several decisions that it had made as its practices were in violation of the HAMP program. I would greatly appreciate if Bank of America would take the necessary steps to reply to these issues responsibly so that this can come to a close. 

I have attached all documentation that is in my possession to support my claims.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",MO,633XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/28/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3112160

Origin : The E-fraud prevention team from HSBC bank called me on XX/XX/XXXX and wanted me to confirm some recent online activities on my accounts. I missed their phone call initially so I tried to call back that afternoon but the wait time is too long. I finally managed to call them back next morning on XXXX. The representative informed me my accounts was compromised. He went through the unauthorized transactions with me and said only the transaction of {$4000.00} can be recalled immediately and for the rest they will investigate and get back to me in a few days. 

Couple days later I am able to see one transaction ( {$8600.00} ) credited back to my account. I called them for a status on the remaining transactions and they are still working on that. That representative said it would take a maximum of 10 days to get me a final response otherwise will credit full amount back to my accounts. 

On XXXX, I sent a formal letter to HSBC headquarter in XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to notify them that I am a victim of identity theft and never authorize anyone else to use my accounts in any way. This is to protect me in case the bank said I never contact them in written statement about the matter. 

Afterward I called them a couple of times on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to get a status for the remaining transactions, and every time I was told I need to wait few more days to finish their investigation.

I had just gotten one in XX/XX/XXXX and was doing fine and knew I would not get another. I explained to her very clearly that I don't have a computer, printer or internet and would need papers mailed to me. All she said was I'd get them in a week to 10 days. Never saw any. Called and asked again. Same thing. No papers. Finally third time she says oh we can't mail forms just the tax form. Meanwhile months have gone by. Getting more behind and won't take any paynents. On my own I finally figure out how to download forms on my cell. Then find out how to fill them in on my cell. Took weeks because print is so small. At no time does this person tell me about refinancing or loan repayment plans only modification. After getting all paperwork in she wants a letter about taxes and then a letter saying not to use my husbands info. When I later asked her about this she denied it.

This is creating issues for me such as higher interest rates, lower credit scores, job declines, and application rejects for outstanding balances owed. 

I disputed this account XX/XX/2019 on my XXXX  and XXXX  credit reports to no avail. To date, Barclays Bank Delaware continues to ignore my requests and they continue to ignore my consumer rights. 

I believe this account does not belong to me. I requested the documents from their files used to verify this account. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to demand they disclose all of the documents they have recorded and retained in their files at the time of the request concerning the accounts that are reporting in my credit report. All unverified accounts must be deleted. 

Who verified this account? What documents did they use to verify? Where are the documents used to verify? 

The only correspondence that I received was a letter informing me they received my dispute. This does not qualify as verification per FCRA. This company is in violation for continuing to verify the account with the credit bureaus without providing the evidence as requested. It is my contention that Barclays Bank Delaware knows they can not tie me to this alleged account, otherwise, they would have done so when I made my initial request.

Say what? You don't want my money? Anyways, Greentree apparently changed the terms of the loan and now I have an escrow account. Two years later I realized it wasn't going away because I was paying homeowners insurance and property taxes twice which ripped me off for over {$6000.00} cuz I wasn't looking. This is when I heard of Greentree / XXXX XXXX Class Action Lawsuit and suddenly I'm back with Ditech ( but with altered terms- escrow ). For the last 3 years I have tried to get Ditech to remove the escrow requirements since they are not my primary mortgage lender. Ditech finally did after some "" legal intervention '' but now charge me a {$6.00} monthly "" servicing '' fee and every year they force place insurance policies on my account and the phone calls start all over again.

03/18/19,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I had a credit card with Barclays. The dispute came from fees they assessed against my account. I always pay my bill in full, and they suddenly charged over {$50.00} in interest one month. I discovered later that they did this because they accidentally posted a payment on my account, and they charged me interest for three months from the time they posted the payment until they discovered the error. During these 3 months, I had been paying the full amount on my bill by the due date. 

When I discovered Barclays ' error, I made the payment in the amount that they had posted, but I contested the amount of interest because it was not my fault. I received 3 standard responses that "" We are unable to complete your request. '' I stopped using my Barclays credit card, started making arrangements to get a new credit card, and I used {$75.00} in "" rewards '' to reduce my balance. Then, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that stated that they had posted {$29.00} in "" interest charge-purchases '' on my account on XX/XX/XXXX. The amount was the balance on my account, not the fees/interest that Barclays had charged on my account. Regardless, upon receiving that letter, I wrote a check in amount of {$29.00}, returned my credit card, and asked them to close my account, with the hope that I would no longer deal with Barclays. 

Since then, I have continued to received bills from Barclays. Apparently, they are charging a fee over {$20.00} per month on an account that has been closed and paid in full. In XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a letter to explain that they had not properly investigated my dispute, and that I should get a refund instead of bills. I received no response. Instead, I received a new statement in the amount of {$41.00}. 

I am writing to complain that Barclays ( 1 ) failed to investigate a dispute as required by the Truth in Lending Act, and ( 2 ) continued to charge fees on a closed account that has been paid in full. 

I am attaching my correspondence with Barclays regarding this matter.

XXXX XXXX SSN : XXXX | DOB : XX/XX/XXXX Experian XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX I am outraged that your company continues to maintain a dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy as confirmed on my credit report. This unconfirmed, unverified, and dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy has stopped me from obtaining credit. I know for a fact your company receives information on bankruptcy from a third party system known as a XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX is inaccurate and incomplete since the XXXX XXXX does not provide complete social security numbers as that would be against the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Privacy Laws. Furthermore, I have been in contact with the county courthouse and they also assured me they do not report full social security numbers to thirty parties or make social security numbers public record. Even though it is your company 's policy to keep reporting a bankruptcy that is filed, dismissed, or adjudicated for 10 years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681 ( c ) relating to bankruptcy about dismissals or filings. The law is very clear and states from the date of adjudication or date of order of relief. 

Any case, whether it be civil or otherwise, once dismissed it no longer exists in the eyes of the law. This case filed may never have actually been adjudicated. You have no right to maintain information which the government has deemed non-existent. It is only fair that in accordance with section 1618 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act you delete this from my credit report and send me an updated copy.

Considering this does not require an investigation, I would appreciate an updated copy of my credit report showing no bankruptcy within two weeks from the date you receive this letter.

Attached is a copy of my most recent mortgage statement dated XX/XX/2019 which references a reinstatement amount. ( Attached - PDF Reference 1 ) I have the ability and am prepared to make such payment in a single installment to being this loan current, although such action requires an updated quote from you. ( Attached PDF - Reference 2 ) Additionally, the mortgage statement makes reference that this amount consists of unpaid advance disbursements but does not fully itemize these amounts. ( Attached PDF - Reference 3 ) This property was subject of a foreclosure sale by Sale Committee on XX/XX/2019, although the report of the Committee has not been marked for judicial consideration ( potential approval ) until XX/XX/2019. 

Finally, there appear to be irregularities in the conduct of your legal counsel within this process with respect to Connecticut General Statue 49-31s regarding the concurrent filing of motions for default and judgment upon non-appearing parties. 

Such concurrent filings might be permitted for instances of abandoned or unoccupied residential buildings, however despite the repeated placement of "" XXXX - Vacant '' stickers on an accessory ( storage/garage ) building on the property, there seems to exist no other evidence or rationale to think that this single family home actively occupied by the mortgagor ( me ) had somehow become abandoned property. 

Given the deficiencies in service and process upon me which resulted from this ( apparently ) erroneous application of the accelerated timeline, I ask for ability to reinstate this loan and request such calculation of the reinstatement payment amount in accordance with Connecticut General Statue 49-10a.

They said that the bill was from XX/XX/2013 but could not tell me what the phone number was attached to the bill. I then explained to them that I have been a XXXX customer in good standing for over 15 years and that my monthly payments are automatically deducted from my bank account, and that this wasnt my bill. 

I questioned them as to how they could put this on my credit report without ever sending me a bill. They couldnt answer that question. The person I spoke said that they would send me out a form to dispute the bill. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX with a form included to file a fraud complainant with XXXX. I had never once said that fraud had been committed. I then took this information and went to XXXX and had them look up the account in question.

When I spoke with a representative at XXXX they informed me that they had nothing either, just that they had bought the debt from somewhere. Since I got nowhere with XXXX or XXXX I filed a dispute through all three credit reporting agencies. They all came back that the account was valid. 

I have never received anything from this company ( XXXX  ) no bills no statements nothing.

09/20/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,,,Consent provided,Web,09/20/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3380692

03/17/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Public record information inaccurate,"My husband and I were trying to refinance our home in XXXX, XXXX when we were made aware of an issue on our Equifax report. Our Equifax report listed two bankruptcies ; one in XXXX of XXXX filed with a local court, a true bankruptcy that we did indeed file, and another in XXXX with the same filing number, information, etc. but filed in a different court in a city we had never visited. We of course tried to contact Equifax regarding this information. They did update our credit report, but still listed both bankruptcies with the same filing information. The only thing they changed was the date. Both bankruptcies now have the same true date of filing, but show different counties. This of course has caused issues for us in terms of refinancing as it now looks like we have two bankruptcies on our history. I tried to contact the court at the number Equifax used to "" verify '' the information. The number, XXXX-XXXX-XXXX, is not in service. I actually called this exact number a second time while on the phone with an Equifax representative trying to prove that there was no way they used that phone number to verify the incorrect information and was told "" I should look for another number ''. I further asked how else they were able to contact to verify the information, and they only gave me a physical address. I asked them again how else they were able to verify the information, as I knew they did not personally visit the location, and I was told to look for another contact number. 

I did some research on the secondary filing location of XXXX County. This bankruptcy court has been closed since XXXX, a year before we actually even filed for bankruptcy ( XXXX ), and 3 years before Equifax accepted a new filing from that address ( XXXX ). Upon further investigation and reaching out to people to help, we have learned that this is a very common issue with Equifax. I have emails from a clerk of courts that state that numerous people have had the same issue with Equifax claiming this closed court as a viable entity and accepting bankruptcies from this court address. 

I have spent countless hours on the phone trying to get this fixed. It has been suggested by Equifax representatives and per their advertising while on hold, that we pay for a credit repair service to help us correct this issue. I even had an online message via XXXX messenger from XXXX XXXX stating that a senior representative would be contacting me. This message was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and I have yet to receive any additional contact. I do continue to receive emails that my claim has been looked at, but can no longer login to my Equifax account because my personal information, the same information I use to contact a representative live, does not match their records. I have, of course, called and the only resolution they have come to is that they verified the false bankruptcy court and changed the date of filing. 

I feel like this has been an ongoing issue for consumers like me. The fact that this bankruptcy court has been closed for 6 years and that Equifax is allowing "" verified reports '' from it, is ridiculous. Additionally, the fact that they could not actually give me anyway in which they truly "" verified '' the information, other than a disconnected phone number is VERY disturbing. Our credit is being held hostage and we have no way to negate what Equifax is reporting. Also, the fact that it was constantly suggested via their advertising and through their own agents that we should go through their "" preferred partner '', XXXX, further incites me, as people should not have to pay to have fraudulent/unverifiable information removed from THEIR personal credit report.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NC,27592,,Consent provided,Web,03/18/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3182509

08/29/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"My Challenge in a nut shell is the servicing lenders sell the contract and dont apply the payments correctly. 

This is the third time this has happened in 2 years. I send the servicing folks emails and call and then get a reply they have 30 days to get back to me and dont. 

This started in XX/XX/XXXX when Selene finance took over my Mortgage payment. Selene Finance wrote I was behind 90 days and if I didnt pay they would foreclose on my home. 

However the previous lender received XXXX for property taxes, mortgage payments in XXXX. In the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Selene finance said I had to take it up with that company this is what I owed. So I did pay them all the payments. But because I had waited on trying to get the funds placed property I was assessed "" property Assessment '' of XXXX to XXXX charges every week. 

After I paid the 90 days of payments and excessive fees I signed the mortgage contracts to have ACH withdrawal. However 2 days later I called and stopped the ACH withdrawal from XXXX and then I called and places stop payments for the ACH withdrawals. I was nervous the payments would not be placed correctly since I was over paying to go to interest. 

Unfortunately Selene finance Did not stop the ACH withdrawal so I did at my bank. This caused all the OD fees that were not OD fees but cancelled ACH pulls. Selene would auto pay my account it gets rejected as a stop payment and I get tagged XXXX they then would pull again the next day same thing XXXX in fees rejected. 

My Bill pay checks would put on the account with the extra funds to go to OD fees or property assessment fees. Instead of to interest. 

I would call, Selene customer Service phone person, would say resubmit I would, then I would get charges XXXX for each Bank charge from them saying NSF when it was not NSF but they sent back. I have times I called, who I spoke with including follow-up emails. After 6 months of this I finally was able to get a hold of a supervisor who went thru the account with me reversed the XXXX od fees places the extra payments correctly and revered the XXXX property assessment fees. 

All goes well until XXXX of XXXX when check was sent back, attached ... 

this was the same practice that caused all the excessive fees again. the supervisor placed the funds correctly. Selene finance kept charging me the XXXX until XXXX. With the customary letter of NSF/ ACH. This came back on XXXX. I resent the Check. Again 2 more XXXX fees for the XXXX stop payments from ACH withdrawal payments thats was cashed by Selene finance. My XXXX payment was cashed with no problem sent as bill pay. and still OD fees.XXXX I call in XXXX, to Selene finance when I receive the letter that my contracts were sold to XXXX XXXX. However XXXX XXXX  says I owe 90 days of payments XXXX XXXX and XXXX. 

I sent my XXXX payment it was sent back. on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent my XXXX payment and it was accepted by XXXX XXXX who know tell me I owe for 6 months of payments plus fees. If I do not pay they will foreclose on my home. 

I have sent to both parties emails showing the copies of the cashed checks to both parties. Yet Selene finance will not contact me. I have asked for mediation on the excess fees and accounting practices Nothing. 

I have all emails and correspondence I have sent to all parties. XXXX XXXX has not had me sign any paperwork for them yet. No mortgage paperwork. 

Please any help would be great. I am concerned they will foreclose on my home..

The New Jersey class action claimed Equifax violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by sending letters that falsely told consumers that it confirms the veracity of disputed public-record information by contacting the source a county court, in this instance directly. 
In reality, however, Equifax never directly contacts the public-information sources, and uses a third-party company to investigate the disputed information, the suit claimed. 
In response to a consumers dispute regarding the accuracy of a public record, it [ Equifax ] never contacts the original source of the information, but rather contacts the private independent company that it never discloses to the consumer, according to the suit.

03/03/19,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Navient gave me wrong information regarding deferments. Navient told me I could not cancel my deferment and make payments. Navient, it seems, did not process my payments correctly. Navient did not refer me to XXXX when I requested to be in the 10 year loan forgiveness program. 

When I went back to school XX/XX/2016 at XXXX my loan automatically went into deferment. When I called Navient to say I still wanted to make payments toward my 120 qualifying payments for loan forgiveness, Navient told me that I if I made payments while I was in deferment the payments would not be counted towards the 120 payments. I said I did not want my loan in deferment. The Navient rep told me that while I was in school my loan would be in deferment and I did not have to make payments while it was in deferment. Again I said I don't want my loan in deferment. I asked how can this be resolved? The Navient rep had no answer for me. I called back again to talk with another rep who gave me the same story. I found out from another Navient rep a year later that what I was told was not true. I could have continued to make IBR payments, I needed to call another phone number to request a deferment cancellation and reapply for an IBR plan.

XXXX XXXX who now has my loan and has taken a year so far to process Navients payments. XXXX has said that they needed to carefully look at each one to make sure it was processed correctly and is a qualifying payment. There automated system only found 6 qualifying payments, there are 31 more payments that need to be looked at more closely by hand. These payments may or may not be qualifying.

Additionally, Navient told me that I didnt have to fill out any paperwork to apply for the loan forgiveness program. I asked several times in the 5 years. They said I just needed to make IBR payments for 10 years and my loan will be forgiven. I found out from a co-worker that I should have submitted an application for the student loan forgiveness. When I talked to Navient about this form they gave me the number for XXXX  and told me that XXXX handle the processing of this form. Navient rep also said that I didn't have to fill out this form but it was a good idea. They also made it seem like XXXX just processed these applications. I realize after filling out the online application and paperwork that my loan was being transferred from Navient to XXXX and that XXXX was another loan handler.

Problems I am having -- Problem 1 -- I missed a year of payments because Navient told me that I couldnt make IBR payments while I was in deferment and that I couldnt get out of deferment while I was in school. This was incorrect. I could have been one year closer to being finished with these loans. And if I get stuck with this loan because Navient didn't process my payments correctly I'm paying a years worth of interest on top of that. Problem 2 -- Navient should have sent me to XXXX XXXX from the beginning if they could not provide adequate services, paperwork and application for the 10 year loan forgiveness payment plan. Problem 3 -- XXXX says I only have 6 qualifying  payments from Navient so far, and Ive made over 5 YEARS worth of payments with Navient.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",WI,,,Consent provided,Web,03/03/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3167739

I immediately disputed this amount along with the balance. A 60 day investigation was opened and XXXX XXXX informed me I would not be charged additional interest fees during this time. When the investigation was complete, I was still charged interest and the balance increased well over 1000 dollars. XXXX wanted me to pay XXXX as the very first payment on the account. I tried to resolve this with XXXX XXXX and leaned I was being charged double interest and double monthly payments on two separate balances! My spouse and I were not informed of these terms In-Store by the Assistant and Store Managers. We also did not agree to these terms. I was never given a copy of my new account contract, only my Sales Receipt that showed XXXX dollars as a minimum monthly payment.

XXXX XXXX and XXXX continued to call my phone from restricted numbers, so I asked for a Cease and Desist.

02/26/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX I made arrangements with the so called Sr. loan officer at Fortren Funding located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX to refinance my mortgage and ever since then I have been complaining because they think their swift in covering up costly numbers for their clients and am fully on to their scheme in robbing innocent families with outstanding credit, then destroy them with phony personnel. It started when XXXX XXXX told me to stop making payments to my current lender at ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX at this point XXXX XXXX  stated to me to let my new LENDER know that they will not pay my taxes for the 1st quarter. I let XXXX know about this and at first it was OK. and after mid month I received a late payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then contacted XXXX and XXXX XXXX another sales manager who went over my documentation to clarify my credit history and sign docs to qualify for the loan and had an XXXX credit score.So I cancelled ... This is when XXXX contacted me and said "" no '' don't cancel because it was only a matter of my tax payment that the title company refused to pay up front for me to start my escrow account. However, we can start the process again the following month because there is still time before my 1st quarter taxes were due and I will submit the same contract again with no closing cost to you and don't worry about the late fee because you are still saving 2 hundred a month to keep your 2nd home. I said "" please put this in writing and e-mail me that info ... and he did so ''. XXXX then instructed a Title company named XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time located in XXXX nj to arrange documentation on what we discussed And when XXXX XXXX arrived to my home on the evening mentioned XX/XX/XXXX she arrived with the HUD and we signed documents together as well as an unpaid hospice bill that appeared under my Dad 's name before he passed away in XXXX and simply had this removed from damaging my credit by notarizing that I was solely XXXX XXXX XXXX not XXXX ... And discussed like XXXX had mentioned to me that "" although he said, "" that there is no additional closing cost..there will be 500.00 from out of pocket expenses for the title agent and other fee if I can come up with XXXX with a cashier 's check to meet the tax deadline, since I will be skipping 2 monthly payments and receiving a disbursement check "" from my old lender ( XXXX XXXX ) for the amount of 1900 and change but not until LATER in XXXX since my old escrow account is being washed. and there we go XXXX stated, I also asked XXXX about the XXXX being the tax deadline and questioned how taxes were being paid and XXXX stated, they had to be escrowed into mortgage account from title company for recording and mentioned that it's a refinance and a few days late will not effect anything maybe a few extra dollars. He also told me to remember that we were brother 's being that were both from the same town 1 mile apart. At this time XXXX told both myself and my girlfriend that this cashier 's check is strictly for my tax payment and nothing else and attached it with the 1st payment letter on the HUD and mentioned again "" for taxes only! '' as she held it up to us. And this is where it does get tricky because the actual contract on the HUD realize is the original contract from when XXXX then XXXX stepped in as the Sr. loan officer to service the majority of this loan, XXXX or known as XXXX started the contract to approve my loan. So being numbers were left the same from the previous month evidently there has been a history of confusion and me and my family had to sacrifice over what XXXX had mentioned was a HUGE mistake and would have this problem handled ASAP for me when I contacted him by XX/XX/XXXX and asked him why only partial payment was made towards my taxes? I contacted him a few weeks later and told him that my taxes were still due but not delinquent and will have to pay on my own since I had a ton of money at that time. XXXX and my township asked why should I if I already escrowed them? And my town stated that they will put a yellow sticker on? XXXX said he checked again and they would be paying them soon. By the following year of XX/XX/XXXX I was receiving odd e-mails about unauthorized payments from my checking account for late payments from XXXX XXXX located over seas where all negative information was recorded to my credit history as well as the unpaid lien that was from my father 's and had to pay numerous penalties and fees for this error. By XX/XX/XXXX my car payment drastically increased along with my mortgage payment costing me an extra cost of living of 300.00 per month with an escrow shortage and canceled credit card. When I contacted XXXX he asked me who paid my taxes? I told him XXXX and he did not say anything but he will get back. I called again and this is when he disconnected his phone. I finally called in XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to anther man XXXX XXXX who I never met and would not know what XXXX and I actually arranged. So he stated that he was taking charge of this loan and took a look at it and asked if this was a no appraisal fee and skipping 2 payments I said yes. he then asked me if I received a disbursement check? I said yes, then XXXX asked what did I do with it? spend it! I said yes towards my 1st 2 voucher payments made to fortren funding in the amount of XXXX when my payments were less than that amount and ended up with an escrow shortage after the 1st analysis came due from the negligence from the originators from what I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX and went directly to a credit service then sold to them delinquent after contacting their ombudsman dept. XXXX then told me it was too late to make any changes and not to have no more contact with them because no one is here to help me except my current lender who ever they were because my loan got all screwed up. By the time it was then sold to XXXX XXXX   my current lender I was and have been facing more escrow shortages, late payments diminished credit score and had to sell my second home and became XXXX because I thought this was a temporary mishap. And having no choice than to pay the losses to avoid losing my primary residence. By the summer of XXXX I was facing XXXX losses and submitting many complaints but the damages at that time were not severe enough for me to pursue and I received a phone call from a third party at Fortren Funding XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX and he told me that XXXX is no longer available to explain how this loan fell out of my favor and would be too costly in court with all of the banks handling my loan and suggested that I request a loan modification where that would reduce my interest another point and any liens that were recorded would be forgotten and that none of these consumer complaints believe me because the XXXX messed up the paperwork. I knew that this was another false misrepresentation so I reported all of this to my current lender. I also did contact other authorities. An experienced Sr.loan officer with my credit history and the HUD presented to them is self explanatory with the 48th month history if examining, the timing of the disbursement check which I was accused of spending towards my taxes ... HUD 1 settlement statement lines XXXX fees XXXX line XXXX taxes ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX with tax certificate showing that taxes were open for XX/XX/XXXX on the evening at closing. And the payoff to my former lender ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) At this time of course everyone involved has avoided any involvement in this criteria and are probably out there in other offices after closing down. Hopefully this will give a clearer picture how these people who can not maintain their own lives, careers and jobs, families etc.It 's the people who work hard like my father did and I who have outstanding credit and a work history of 39 straight years in the work force until I had to work harder at XXXX years old for what started as a simple mistake.

I already disputed this with the credit bureaus and they verified it as being accurate. I am not sure how this happened, I |thought that I had made my payments to you on time when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me or maybe an error occurred where it wasn't recorded on time. 

I do ask in light of the good standing relationship we have that you remove any late payments from my credit report and refund me any late fees that were added to my account. I do not believe it is accurate. 

I would rather not have to spend more time than necessary for both of us to resolve this situation so I was hoping that instead of escalating anything, that you could help me with this and report me as being 100 % on time. 

I appreciate your help regarding this and look forward to keep having the positive experience that I have had with you in the past.

I, XXXX XXXX, had lost my job in XXXX. Notified the mortgage lender, HSBC, of the matter. I didn't land a job until approximately 3 months later, informed HSBC that I will began making payments in doubles until I was caught up, however, they had told me that there was a new policy stating that the whole past due amount ( totaling appx. 5000.00 dollars ) would need to be paid. Furthermore, no payment smaller than the past due amount would be accepted. 

At that time, it was winter going into spring, in XXXX New York. Therefore, I was behind in the heat and electricity, the car loan, and owed back payments in child support. There was no way for me to be able to pay the amount that was requested by HSBC. Hence, the house ended up in foreclosure. I could not afford a lawyer, at that time and still can not. 

After many phone calls, and time passing, the loan that had plagued my life, had been closed. The house was sold in an auction in XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, according to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( contact info : XXXX ). Although, on my credit report it shows that the account had been closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I do not understand how they had closed the account on this date when I was still making payments until I was unemployed.

She got the account information but she entered the information for the account number wrong. OnXX/XX/XXXX my husband realized the amount never came out of our Wells Fargo checking account and called Wells Fargo back to find out why. The representative acknowledged their error and fixed the account draft and processed it correctly. The XXXX cleared our bank account on XX/XX/. 

On XX/XX/, we called Wells Fargo to check on our satisfaction of our lien that had not been processed with the XXXX County Register of Deeds. In NC there is a 30 day requirement to release a lien. The representative advised that they showed the lien had not been released and would send an urgent request to the lien release department to XXXX this paperwork. We were told that a representative would call me with this information. We received no call back. On XX/XX/, we called Wells Fargo back and were advised no additional work had been processed by the lien release department. A case was opened with the executive escalation department. OnXX/XX/XXXX, we called the executive department and received no updates to our request. Around XXXX the same day, a representative named XXXX from Wells called to say he was handling our request. He proceeded to state that my loan was not paid off and that I still owed {$450.00} since the first automatic draft did not complete.

12/10/18,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,I added my son to my NFCU business account as an authorized user about 2 years ago or so. He was added with no problem. Today XX/XX/2018 my business assets are frozen because he owes them money and they blocked me out of my own business accounts. Apparently he owes them over {$5000.00} and they restricted my account because according ti them they can do that. My son went into a branch as was grossly discriminated against and treated like a criminal when I sent him to get a cashiers check. He has called in several times with me and they have been rude and We have been hung up on and when trying to speak to a supervisor I am advised that there is no one working that someone will return my call in 24 to 48 hours. According to what I know these accounts are from XX/XX/2010 and they are declining to forward information to validate the debt. On the recorded line the rep insisted he say that He acknowledge that he owes the money after repeated attempts by the rep in their recovery she hung up and became rude. By them restricting access to my buainess account it will cost me a total of about XXXX to XXXX in fees and other legal costs because of that. My business should not be responsible of them not verifying his information when I added him over 2 years ago. They should have said no of instead taking opportunity to try to collect on a business account that frankly he is only authorized to go when I am not available. I feel that these actions were initiated as a retaliation because they made me go through hoops about a code word on the account and because I stated that I would report them to the proper authorities.,Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,AZ,853XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/10/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3096884

On the previous month 's report dated XX/XX/XXXX : 1 ) The balance changes from {$7300.00} to {$7400.00} which is not accurate! The other two bureaus show different balances!

2 ) The date of last payment switches from the month before from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX! Very inaccurate! 

On the previous months report dated XX/XX/XXXX 1 ) They are reporting a monthly payment of {$0.00} which is not accurate! 
2 ) Same issue with balance reporting {$7300.00} when the month before was {$7400.00}! Not accurate! 
3 ) The date of last payment is reporting XX/XX/XXXX when the month before it was XX/XX/XXXX On the previous month 's report dated XX/XX/XXXX : 1 ) The balance again is {$7400.00} when it was {$7300.00} 2 ) The date of last payment changed again! All Inaccurate They are just switching numbers all around and it is completely inaccurate by changing the balance, and the, terms, and the monthly payments to different amounts all the time!

09/19/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"Dear Senator XXXX, AGO XXXX and Consumer Protection Bureau via Complaint ID # XXXX As your offices are aware, we have experienced deplorable customer service from JPMorgan Chase on our home mortgage and line of credit since XX/XX/XXXX. 

We are seniors and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX MA XXXX, has been our primary residence since XX/XX/XXXX. We purchased our home on no doc through Washington Mutual. Chase took over the loan in XX/XX/XXXX and we refinanced from a 30 year fixed to a 15 year fixed mortgage Chase in XX/XX/XXXX. At the closing, Chase asked if we wanted a $ XXXX line of credit. We elected to accept only $ XXXX at the time, which was not accessed until XX/XX/XXXX. In  late XX/XX/XXXX, Chase invited us to increase our HELOC line from the $ XXXX to $ XXXX, but at an increase of 2 % on the entire balance. Going through the financial crisis causing negative Government effect on my FCC Broadcast ownership, XXXX and XXXX children in college, we accepted going forward with the new terms. Chase then delayed for months stating our home value decreased and despite adequate funds in the bank and questioned amount of money I was taking from my owned radio station XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA. In XX/XX/XXXX, Chase finally dictated to us that our only option was modification but we had to skip two payments to be considered. 

Chase then reported us to the credit bureaus and the modification approval for the stated 60 months finally came in XX/XX/XXXX, but extended only 42 months with a balloon payment for the full mortgage due XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, Chase miscoded a bank routing number on a payment and then took months to determine it was their error. Then, Chase interrupted our applications for new financing by starting foreclosure notices. Chase further delayed and hindered our efforts to change lenders. 

Finally, after finally being put in touch with the Chase Executive Office in XX/XX/XXXX,  Chase agreed, in XX/XX/XXXX to a second modification at our out of pocket cost of {$36000.00}. Chase refused to spread that amount over the ensuing 200 payments in the second modification. 

In both XX/XX/XXXX and upon our XX/XX/XXXX approval of the second modification, Chase promised to A ) adjust late fees, interest charges and legal fees, B ) make sure the credit bureaus knew we were up to date on the mortgage & HELOC, C ) correct Chases superficial appraisal of our home which is at least $ XXXX too low - $ XXXX compared to a complete modification performed by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at $ XXXX - and D ) make arrangements to finally add to our line of credit. E ) The rate of interest on the new modification is quite high, 4.87 %. 

We continue to get lip service, run around, rude correspondence and phone conversation from Chase. The letters they have sent to me and your offices have no credibility as they do not address Chase mistakes and the horrible, inappropriate manner of customer service from Chase. The Chase letters repeat their old decisions that were incorrect in the first place. 

We are seniors, never bankrupt, with a Chase debt of less than $ XXXX on our primary/only residence HUD and the CPB valued several months ago at over {$1.00} million. Chase is disregarding the importance of our Senior Financial Health and discriminating against seniors ability to have simple access to less than 49 % of their home equity for medical, improvement, college and living expenses. Further, Chase has been rude and tremendously challenged in delaying proceedings. Chase representatives stall, take months to say its not this department and have told us to find another lender, get a reverse mortgage or move! 

With a tremendous amount of phone, email, letter, fax correspondence shared with your offices and Chase, I must ask that you now step in and hold Chase accountable for this harmful, stressful, prolonged and costly behavior negatively affecting us, and other senior customers. We ask for all fee and interest adjustments and for a favorable arrangement to have access to up to 49 % of our home FMV, without further delay. 

Please respond and thank you for protecting senior citizens who need and deserve your intervention.

There was an incident that happened with my company and the merchant that was involved to receive my payments so they could ship the products to my customers but they canceled the transaction prior when the purchased occurred. 

However, I have contacted the merchant company which was XXXX to asked what happened after a couple of days without my knowledge of knowing what had happened. I recall one of the customer service said the transaction was canceled within 24 hours so which clearly means the products didn't get fulfilled for my customers.

From this point I'm confident that they will release/refund my money which they did, they simply refunded within 72 hours. So which means banks release the money within 3-5 business days to my account.

I have waited for more than 10 days, I was like maybe something went wrong with the merchant so I contacted them and they said usually this takes 3-20 business days, so I'm satisfied and moved on with my month, 30 days passed and still, nothing is happening. I definitely contacted the bank and told them that I still didn't receive the money. 

I filed a claim dispute on XX/XX/XXXX. The bank reached out to the merchant on XX/XX/XXXX. Literary the bank took that much time to reach out, their word was "" 90 days '' to get this solved. 90 days passed around XX/XX/XXXX, and they said : "" we have to wait until 90 days for the merchant to get back to us. '' What totally made me reach out to you guys was, this has been almost more than 100 days since when they said "" 90 days '' for the consumer, not the merchant. 

I would like my funds back. All I wanted was them to push that button and release my money to my account since the merchant already refunded me. I lost my trust with Bank Of America, I would like you guys to come in and help me with this case because they clearly give zero XXXX for the customers.

02/19/19,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"We entered into a loan modification application process with Wells Fargo on our FHA Rehab mortgage in XX/XX/XXXXXXXX. We provided all requested documentation and were approved, and given a lower monthly payment on a 90 day trial period. No information was given as to how they arrived at this payment, or what would happen for them to achieve this payment amount, until AFTER we paid 3 months of trial payments. 

We made the first two trial period payments and Wells Fargo sent us a letter that we'd been removed from the program. I called them and found out they had sent us a letter that we had to sign and send back agreeing to the trial period. They didn't tell us it would be coming or required and it was apparently sent via regular mail, not certified or overnighted, and we never received it. That's 2 payments made. 

So they started us over again, new trial period, and we made 3 payments in XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. That's 5 trial period payments we made at that point. We received an email that we'd been approved for the HAMP modification and would be receiving paperwork that we would need to have notarized and sent back. No details as to what it was or any figures. Just an approval email. 

We received an overnight packet from XXXX  with the modification paperwork and figures. I called in to Wells Fargo after looking over the numbers, and I wanted a detailed itemization of the figures that they came up with to modify the loan. My foreclosure "" specialist '' could not answer these simple questions - even though all the numbers are there in their computer system. She got belligerent with me on the phone about how I "" better make the payment '', etc ... I sent several emails and left voicemails with ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE back. NO email responses from her, NO letters in the mail, NO return phone calls. 

I called and made another payment over the phone with someone else on XX/XX/XXXX ( after no explanations, no responses and no calls returned ), and then on XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a letter in the mail that they "" are no longer moving forward with the HAMP program '' for our account. 

A few days later, I receive a letter from their foreclosure attorney, and last Thursday, the sheriff posted the court documents on my front door that state our foreclosure hearing is set with the county on  XX/XX/XXXX. 

We qualified for, and were approved for, a HAMP loan modification. We did not however, know what was involved prior to the trial period payments - only what the payment itself would be. 

I am not happy with the modification numbers and did not sign the documents that were sent to me, instead I wanted to work with my mortgage company to see if there was an alternative, but they REFUSE TO RESPOND and now have us set for foreclosure. I feel my rights as a consumer have been violated by the mortgage company refusing to answer questions or explain their figures, which I believe are double-dipping, and possibly fraudulent or illegal.

I have all emails I sent to the foreclosure "" specialist '' and records of calls and voicemails left that were never returned. Every letter the specialist ever sent clearly stated "" please call me if you have any questions ''. I had questions - she refused to answer them, and then refused to respond altogether. She removed us from the program instead. Even though we qualified for assistance. I just want to verify the numbers before signing - because they show that we will end up owing more than we started with after making three years ' worth of payments. And they were increasing our interest rate, not lowering it. They took a chunk of the principal balance and "" amount in deliquency '' ( the number they refused to explain how they arrived at it ) and are setting it out as a perpetual silent second mortgage that will never be paid down or paid off until we sell or refinance the property. At which time, WF will receive all of that money - double dipping when they get it. We were not given any other option as far as lower interest rate, extended term of the mortgage, nothing.

And now, thanks to WF XXXX us around, we're even further behind in the payments. This should have been handled in a timely manner and it was NOT. It's been over 90 days since I made the 3rd payment of the trial period, and I made an additional payment last month in XXXX after not hearing anything from them. Now that they've set a court hearing, they won't accept another payment from me, and that will cause more months to go behind. 

On top of that, this company receives millions of dollars in HAMP funds each year to help people struggling with their payments - there is no evidence in these numbers that ANY HAMP funds were being used to help us. I'm not asking for free money, but if the government intends those funds to be used to help people, and WF isn't using them to do just that, then WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH THOSE MILLIONS ( WILL BE BILLIONS BY XXXX WHEN IT ENDS ) OF DOLLARS IN HAMP FUNDS? Are they just eating that money? My trial payment letter clearly states we were in a HAMP loan modification. But every dollar is showing it's coming from us in the end, not HAMP funds at all. And now, the HAMP program is no longer accepting applications? 

I don't know where to turn at this point. But I believe this is an illegal foreclosure.

( 2 ) A fraudulent practice or conduct is characterized by deceit or trickery, an intentional perversion of the truth to induce another to part with something of value or to surrender a legal right, or an act of deceiving or misrepresenting. Fraud also includes any other  definition of fraud under applicable law. Example A : A mortgage originator employed by a mortgage broker has promised a certain low-rate mortgage loan to a consumer. However, the consumer does not have the minimum debt-to-income ratio set by the lender preferred by the mortgage originators employer to qualify for the lowest-rate mortgage loan offered. Therefore, the mortgage originator changes the XXXX statement of the consumer to reflect a higher income for the consumer without the consumers knowledge, and then submits the documentation to the lender. Example B : An employee of a mortgage lender contacts a real estate appraiser with a request to perform an appraisal and informs the appraiser that the sale price of the property is {$150000.00}. The employee knows that the property will not appraise for that amount, but promises the appraiser future business if the appraiser can make the deal work. The mortgage loan is closed by the mortgage lender based upon the appraisal report showing the value of the property as {$150000.00}. I was tricked into this mortgage during desperate times. The interest rate is 9.75 % fixed. I had been paying interest-only for 10 years, and in XXXX I was required to start paying principal and interest.
